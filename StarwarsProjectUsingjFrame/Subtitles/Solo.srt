1
00:00:56,592 to 00:00:57,281
Come on.
2
00:00:58,123 to 00:00:59,059
Come on!
3
00:01:09,551 to 00:01:11,108
Don't let him get away!
5
00:01:58,041 to 00:01:59,375
Get inside now!
6
00:01:59,415 to 00:02:01,285
Hurry up! You're late!
7
00:02:04,121 to 00:02:06,189
Proxima's gonna
have your hide.
8
00:02:07,505 to 00:02:09,032
Get back in the den.
9
00:02:11,340 to 00:02:12,514
Look what I stole!
10
00:02:12,554 to 00:02:14,564
Proxima'll give me
an extra portion for this!
11
00:02:14,604 to 00:02:16,520
Nope, I think she's gonna
give that extra portion to me.
12
00:02:16,560 to 00:02:17,390
Hey, give it back!
13
00:02:17,430 to 00:02:18,564
It belongs to
whoever's holding it!
14
00:02:18,604 to 00:02:19,489
And that's not you!
15
00:02:19,529 to 00:02:20,724
Lex!
16
00:02:21,042 to 00:02:22,109
Full Sabacc!
17
00:02:22,149 to 00:02:23,455
Idiot's Array.
18
00:02:23,495 to 00:02:24,504
What? Let me see that!
19
00:02:24,544 to 00:02:25,623
Nope, it's my card.
20
00:02:25,663 to 00:02:26,675
You cheat.
21
00:02:27,575 to 00:02:28,409
Han!
22
00:02:32,625 to 00:02:34,086
You were gone too long!
23
00:02:34,148 to 00:02:35,595
I knew something
must've gone wrong.
24
00:02:35,635 to 00:02:37,201
This is nothing.
You should see them.
25
00:02:37,241 to 00:02:38,277
Look down here!
26
00:02:39,681 to 00:02:40,710
All right, listen.
27
00:02:40,750 to 00:02:42,079
I was in the middle
of the exchange,
28
00:02:42,119 to 00:02:43,241
I'm handing over
the coaxium
29
00:02:43,281 to 00:02:45,084
and his goons jumped me,
but I showed 'em.
30
00:02:45,124 to 00:02:45,721
How?
31
00:02:45,761 to 00:02:47,896
I ran away, then I
boosted their speeder.
32
00:02:47,936 to 00:02:48,956
What, are we
going somewhere?
33
00:02:48,996 to 00:02:50,764
Yeah, anywhere we want.
34
00:02:51,755 to 00:02:54,271
You held on to
one of the vials?
35
00:02:54,452 to 00:02:55,453
Han's back!
36
00:02:57,681 to 00:02:59,276
This,
this is worth...
37
00:02:59,316 to 00:03:00,266
Five, six hundred credits.
38
00:03:00,306 to 00:03:02,471
That's more than
you said we'd need.
39
00:03:02,532 to 00:03:04,710
To buy our way out
of the control zone.
40
00:03:04,750 to 00:03:06,141
And off Corellia.
41
00:03:06,181 to 00:03:09,249
Han, this could work.
42
00:03:09,289 to 00:03:10,375
This is gonna work.
43
00:03:10,415 to 00:03:12,944
Qi'ra, you always said one day
we're gonna get out of here.
44
00:03:13,246 to 00:03:14,280
This is it.
45
00:03:15,699 to 00:03:17,101
What are we waiting for?
46
00:03:22,233 to 00:03:24,662
There he is.
Hey, you two!
47
00:03:27,910 to 00:03:29,576
Moloch. Hi, how are ya?
48
00:03:29,616 to 00:03:31,863
I was just on my way
to see Lady Proxima.
49
00:03:34,531 to 00:03:36,943
What a night I had.
50
00:03:37,020 to 00:03:39,172
You're not gonna believe it.
You'll believe it, but...
51
00:03:40,150 to 00:03:42,312
Hold still, scrumrat!
52
00:03:43,901 to 00:03:44,915
Easy.
53
00:03:46,159 to 00:03:47,076
Come on.
54
00:03:47,116 to 00:03:48,204
All right.
55
00:03:48,806 to 00:03:50,459
Let's go see Lady Proxima.
56
00:04:11,258 to 00:04:14,046
Well, what happened?
57
00:04:14,086 to 00:04:15,383
I'll tell you what happened.
58
00:04:15,423 to 00:04:17,594
They doublecrossed you
and tried to kill me.
59
00:04:17,634 to 00:04:18,431
The money?
60
00:04:18,471 to 00:04:21,242
They kept it.
And my coaxium?
61
00:04:21,707 to 00:04:22,330
They kept that, too.
62
00:04:22,370 to 00:04:24,334
But we learned
a very valuable lesson.
63
00:04:24,374 to 00:04:26,974
We cannot trust those guys.
64
00:04:27,014 to 00:04:28,840
So you expect me to believe
65
00:04:28,925 to 00:04:31,476
that you walked away
with nothing!
66
00:04:33,119 to 00:04:35,764
I ran away with my life.
I think that's something.
67
00:04:36,456 to 00:04:37,961
To me, that's a lot.
68
00:04:38,008 to 00:04:40,269
I trusted you
with a simple task,
69
00:04:40,309 to 00:04:43,044
and all I'm hearing
are excuses.
70
00:04:45,664 to 00:04:49,373
There must be consequences
for disobedience
71
00:04:49,413 to 00:04:52,236
or else you never learn.
72
00:04:58,420 to 00:04:59,367
You know what?
73
00:05:01,161 to 00:05:02,752
I don't think
I'm ever gonna learn.
74
00:05:02,792 to 00:05:04,426
What did you say?
75
00:05:04,528 to 00:05:08,849
I said, next time
somebody hits me,
76
00:05:09,538 to 00:05:11,289
I hit 'em back.
77
00:05:13,971 to 00:05:15,389
Moloch, wait!
78
00:05:15,613 to 00:05:16,756
Don't!
79
00:05:16,796 to 00:05:19,275
Qi'ra, remember the Silo?
80
00:05:19,381 to 00:05:21,149
We pulled you
out of that horror,
81
00:05:21,189 to 00:05:22,691
gave you a home.
82
00:05:22,731 to 00:05:26,407
Don't throw it away for Han.
He's not worth it!
83
00:05:26,447 to 00:05:29,898
Whatever he lost on the deal,
we'll earn it back, double.
84
00:05:29,938 to 00:05:31,225
We will make it up to you.
85
00:05:35,474 to 00:05:37,774
Everybody, stand back!
86
00:05:37,814 to 00:05:39,557
What's that supposed to be?
87
00:05:39,643 to 00:05:41,240
This is a thermal detonator
88
00:05:41,280 to 00:05:43,775
that I just armed.
89
00:05:43,815 to 00:05:46,477
That's a rock!
No, it's not.
90
00:05:46,547 to 00:05:47,340
Yes, it is!
91
00:05:47,380 to 00:05:48,239
And you just made
92
00:05:48,279 to 00:05:50,002
a clicking sound
with your mouth.
93
00:05:50,042 to 00:05:51,766
Please tell me
this isn't your plan.
94
00:05:51,806 to 00:05:53,144
No, this is.
95
00:06:03,352 to 00:06:04,907
Get in!
An M68?
96
00:06:04,947 to 00:06:06,747
Nice, right?
I love it!
97
00:06:14,564 to 00:06:16,000
Whoa!
98
00:06:39,759 to 00:06:42,558
There's a starliner leaving
from Coronet Spaceport,
99
00:06:42,598 to 00:06:43,833
we're gonna be on it.
100
00:06:44,710 to 00:06:47,513
We bribe our way through the
checkpoint, and we're free.
101
00:06:49,081 to 00:06:50,561
I'm gonna be a pilot.
102
00:06:50,913 to 00:06:52,029
We can get our own ship.
103
00:06:52,069 to 00:06:53,947
See the galaxy,
all of it.
104
00:06:54,935 to 00:06:58,763
We won't have to take orders
or be kicked around by anyone.
105
00:06:59,182 to 00:07:00,183
Ever.
106
00:07:03,564 to 00:07:05,732
Thought we'd get a little
more of a head start.
107
00:07:22,554 to 00:07:23,875
Whoa!
Hang on!
108
00:07:33,520 to 00:07:35,203
This is a secure area.
109
00:07:35,243 to 00:07:37,329
You must have
proper clearance.
110
00:07:37,369 to 00:07:40,112
Stop at once! You must
follow the proper...
111
00:07:41,081 to 00:07:42,256
Protocol.
112
00:07:45,055 to 00:07:46,937
Damn!
That stinger's fast.
113
00:07:46,977 to 00:07:49,406
Yeah, but we're faster,
right?
114
00:07:49,816 to 00:07:50,886
I hope so.
115
00:08:21,178 to 00:08:22,370
Pull over!
116
00:08:44,582 to 00:08:45,838
Han, no,
we're not gonna make it!
117
00:08:45,878 to 00:08:46,612
Oh, yeah?
118
00:08:46,652 to 00:08:48,380
Han, I'm telling you,
it's too tight!
119
00:08:48,505 to 00:08:49,885
Watch this.
120
00:09:13,924 to 00:09:14,846
Come on!
121
00:09:15,975 to 00:09:17,144
We gotta move.
122
00:09:28,616 to 00:09:30,083
Do not join the line
123
00:09:30,151 to 00:09:32,881
if you don't have
a boarding pass.
124
00:09:32,984 to 00:09:36,479
No access without ID chip.
125
00:09:36,723 to 00:09:39,729
All droids
must be registered.
126
00:09:41,178 to 00:09:42,848
Move along. Move along.
127
00:09:45,332 to 00:09:47,391
Stand down. Do not resist!
128
00:09:48,555 to 00:09:50,117
Stop struggling.
Let me go!
129
00:09:50,174 to 00:09:51,086
Take his arm.
130
00:09:51,126 to 00:09:51,853
I got him.
131
00:09:51,916 to 00:09:54,024
Take him to cell 3B.
132
00:09:54,064 to 00:09:54,865
This way, come on.
133
00:09:56,305 to 00:09:57,872
Keep moving.
Hold it, hold it.
134
00:10:00,216 to 00:10:01,351
Next.
135
00:10:05,597 to 00:10:07,333
Han, they're here.
136
00:10:10,231 to 00:10:11,007
Hey, what are you...
137
00:10:11,047 to 00:10:14,073
We're almost there.
138
00:10:14,113 to 00:10:16,077
Just hold on to me.
Next.
139
00:10:16,117 to 00:10:17,152
Don't look back.
140
00:10:18,195 to 00:10:20,700
Once we're through,
we've gotta be smart,
141
00:10:20,786 to 00:10:22,210
figure out
where we're going.
142
00:10:22,269 to 00:10:24,226
Anywhere the Empire isn't.
Wherever we go,
143
00:10:24,272 to 00:10:25,738
it can't be worse
than where we've been.
144
00:10:25,808 to 00:10:29,271
Yes, it can. Out there,
we've got no protection.
145
00:10:29,311 to 00:10:31,440
We could get snatched up
by traffickers,
146
00:10:31,480 to 00:10:34,008
sold to Crimson Dawn
or the Hutt Cartel.
147
00:10:34,048 to 00:10:36,166
That's not gonna happen.
148
00:10:36,248 to 00:10:37,416
I won't let it.
149
00:10:45,125 to 00:10:45,760
For luck?
150
00:10:47,161 to 00:10:48,456
Damn right.
151
00:10:52,211 to 00:10:53,560
You heard him. Let's go.
152
00:10:53,600 to 00:10:54,791
Next.
153
00:10:57,607 to 00:10:59,132
ID chips.
154
00:10:59,172 to 00:11:01,267
Funny thing,
we don't have 'em.
155
00:11:01,707 to 00:11:02,629
We have this.
156
00:11:02,669 to 00:11:04,152
Refined hyperfuel.
157
00:11:04,192 to 00:11:07,112
It's worth at least
800 credits, maybe more.
158
00:11:08,515 to 00:11:10,782
You could be detained
just for having that.
159
00:11:10,822 to 00:11:12,613
What good would
that do anybody?
160
00:11:12,838 to 00:11:14,683
Let us through,
it's all yours.
161
00:11:24,297 to 00:11:26,292
The coaxium, now.
162
00:11:26,378 to 00:11:27,913
As we're going through,
not before.
163
00:11:33,245 to 00:11:34,446
Do it.
164
00:11:36,487 to 00:11:37,621
Just do it, do it.
165
00:11:41,667 to 00:11:44,182
Not so fast, Qi'ra!
Come on!
166
00:11:44,254 to 00:11:45,841
Wait!
Open the door!
167
00:11:45,893 to 00:11:48,413
Security! Security,
there has been a breach!
168
00:11:48,514 to 00:11:49,848
Open the door!
169
00:11:50,120 to 00:11:52,383
Run! Run!
Get your hands off of her!
170
00:11:52,603 to 00:11:53,657
Run!
171
00:11:53,737 to 00:11:55,490
Get your hands off of her!
172
00:11:56,130 to 00:11:57,322
Qi'ra!
173
00:11:57,362 to 00:11:59,691
Run, Han! Go!
174
00:11:59,794 to 00:12:01,125
Keep moving.
175
00:12:03,212 to 00:12:04,495
Qi'ra!
176
00:12:04,535 to 00:12:05,463
Run!
177
00:12:05,503 to 00:12:06,888
Traveler
has been apprehended.
178
00:12:06,928 to 00:12:10,206
Qi'ra, I'll come back!
I'll come back!
179
00:12:12,819 to 00:12:14,802
All units,
there has been a breach.
180
00:12:14,942 to 00:12:18,744
Another unauthorized traveler
made it through the gate.
181
00:12:18,784 to 00:12:20,242
One got through
the gate! Look over there!
182
00:12:20,282 to 00:12:22,411
Someone
got through the checkpoint.
183
00:12:30,148 to 00:12:32,445
Keep an eye on that gate.
Yes, sir.
184
00:12:32,563 to 00:12:33,857
Can't let you through
without a ticket.
185
00:12:33,897 to 00:12:35,432
Can't let you through
without a ticket.
186
00:12:36,397 to 00:12:37,948
Hey, wait!
187
00:12:38,089 to 00:12:39,580
Hey!
Come with us.
188
00:12:42,108 to 00:12:43,764
He's still
out there. Keep looking.
189
00:12:56,202 to 00:12:57,529
You there, stop!
190
00:12:57,569 to 00:13:00,180
Show me some identification.
Please. Please. No, no!
191
00:13:00,230 to 00:13:01,410
Do not resist.
192
00:13:01,450 to 00:13:04,832
Be a part of something.
Join the Empire.
193
00:13:04,981 to 00:13:09,391
Explore new worlds.
Learn valuable skills.
194
00:13:09,456 to 00:13:13,219
Bring order and unity
to the galaxy!
195
00:13:13,274 to 00:13:16,592
Be a part of something.
Join the Empire.
196
00:13:17,996 to 00:13:19,818
This is where I sign up
to be a pilot, right?
197
00:13:19,858 to 00:13:21,402
If you apply
for the Imperial Navy,
198
00:13:21,442 to 00:13:23,236
but most recruits
go into the infantry.
199
00:13:23,276 to 00:13:26,392
I'm gonna be a pilot.
Best in the galaxy.
200
00:13:26,432 to 00:13:28,194
You there,
come with us.
201
00:13:28,234 to 00:13:29,297
Who, me?
202
00:13:29,384 to 00:13:31,182
We have a few questions
to ask you.
203
00:13:31,236 to 00:13:32,971
How long
is that gonna take?
204
00:13:33,011 to 00:13:35,450
Depends on how good you are
at following orders.
205
00:13:35,490 to 00:13:36,885
Why, have you got
somewhere to be?
206
00:13:36,925 to 00:13:39,081
Yeah, back here,
as soon as I can.
207
00:13:40,206 to 00:13:43,535
Don't hear that much.
What's your name, son?
208
00:13:43,616 to 00:13:44,618
Han.
209
00:13:45,001 to 00:13:46,368
Han what?
210
00:13:48,118 to 00:13:49,331
Who are your people?
211
00:13:53,113 to 00:13:55,883
I don't have people.
I'm alone.
212
00:13:57,083 to 00:13:58,084
Han...
213
00:14:01,097 to 00:14:02,218
Solo.
214
00:14:03,985 to 00:14:05,272
Approved.
215
00:14:05,413 to 00:14:09,102
Proceed to transport ID 83 for
the Naval Academy at Carida.
216
00:14:09,734 to 00:14:11,622
Good luck, Han Solo.
217
00:14:11,725 to 00:14:13,241
We'll have you flying
in no time.
218
00:14:26,859 to 00:14:30,324
Your Empire needs you.
Troopers forward!
219
00:14:30,527 to 00:14:32,423
Solo, get up!
We're almost there!
220
00:14:32,514 to 00:14:34,942
Almost where?
Where are we going?
221
00:14:35,013 to 00:14:37,893
Just over that last ridge.
Victory is...
222
00:14:48,169 to 00:14:51,439
My legs! My leg!
223
00:15:07,130 to 00:15:08,839
Hey, Beckett,
you said we were here
224
00:15:08,879 to 00:15:10,196
to pull a quick job.
225
00:15:10,236 to 00:15:12,172
Yeah.
Well, this ain't a quick job!
226
00:15:12,212 to 00:15:13,619
It's a war!
227
00:15:14,487 to 00:15:16,174
It's always
something with you.
228
00:15:17,827 to 00:15:20,724
AThauler.
That's what we came for.
229
00:15:20,764 to 00:15:23,141
Forward operations
must be this way.
230
00:15:23,181 to 00:15:25,810
They are, but the major said
we're supposed to go that way!
231
00:15:25,866 to 00:15:27,825
Yeah, go that way and die!
232
00:15:27,865 to 00:15:30,426
That's exactly what happened
to the major!
233
00:15:30,563 to 00:15:32,768
Who's the ranking
officer now?
234
00:15:32,878 to 00:15:34,497
You are, Captain.
235
00:15:36,509 to 00:15:37,946
He's got you there.
236
00:15:39,876 to 00:15:42,319
So what's the plan,
Captain Beckett?
237
00:15:42,399 to 00:15:45,670
Val, you take Rio and these
four mud skulls flank left.
238
00:15:45,732 to 00:15:47,261
I'll take this
mouthy scooch
239
00:15:47,372 to 00:15:48,516
and we'll go around
to the right
240
00:15:48,569 to 00:15:50,746
and maybe
we'll get lucky.
241
00:15:50,799 to 00:15:52,462
Luck's got
nothin' to do with it.
242
00:15:53,198 to 00:15:55,493
Wait! One question!
243
00:15:55,612 to 00:15:57,775
You wanna live, sparky?
Very much.
244
00:15:57,815 to 00:16:00,301
Then shut up and do what
your captain tells you.
245
00:16:00,930 to 00:16:02,591
Let's go!
246
00:16:16,875 to 00:16:17,628
Captain.
247
00:16:17,668 to 00:16:19,979
T15s are down.
We walk from here.
248
00:16:20,037 to 00:16:21,138
Captain.
249
00:16:23,352 to 00:16:24,418
I'm Han.
250
00:16:25,809 to 00:16:27,109
Nobody cares.
251
00:16:28,692 to 00:16:30,653
Thanks for your help
back there.
252
00:16:30,748 to 00:16:31,951
You did all right.
253
00:16:32,860 to 00:16:34,588
I was trained
in aerial combat...
254
00:16:34,628 to 00:16:36,537
You want some advice?
255
00:16:36,610 to 00:16:37,804
Get the hell
away from here.
256
00:16:37,844 to 00:16:40,380
Any way you can,
as fast as you can.
257
00:16:43,767 to 00:16:44,697
What company
do you command?
258
00:16:44,737 to 00:16:46,471
None of your business
company.
259
00:16:47,003 to 00:16:48,378
And we're full up.
260
00:16:49,354 to 00:16:50,770
Stick
to soldiering, kid.
261
00:16:50,850 to 00:16:52,251
You don't want
any part of this.
262
00:16:58,855 to 00:17:00,090
Hang on, guys!
263
00:17:02,288 to 00:17:03,659
Attention!
264
00:17:04,059 to 00:17:06,960
In three hours, we move out
for the southern marshlands.
265
00:17:07,021 to 00:17:09,618
I want an advance party
of ten men.
266
00:17:09,697 to 00:17:11,499
Great, more mud.
267
00:17:11,570 to 00:17:13,698
What was that?
268
00:17:13,832 to 00:17:16,547
Just wondering what our
objective is, Lieutenant.
269
00:17:16,611 to 00:17:19,408
Bring peace and prosperity
to the galaxy,
270
00:17:19,495 to 00:17:21,400
install a regime
loyal to the Emperor,
271
00:17:21,440 to 00:17:23,445
and eradicate
the hostiles.
272
00:17:23,527 to 00:17:25,741
It's their planet,
we're the hostiles.
273
00:17:26,229 to 00:17:27,993
You got a problem, trooper?
274
00:17:29,181 to 00:17:30,549
No problem, sir.
275
00:17:33,299 to 00:17:34,527
Moving out.
276
00:17:34,786 to 00:17:37,424
To the southern
marshlands! Move out!
277
00:17:37,515 to 00:17:39,483
You heard 'em!
Let's move out!
278
00:17:47,982 to 00:17:49,716
Mmm. Looks like
they're running sorties
279
00:17:49,756 to 00:17:51,343
every 30 minutes.
280
00:17:51,413 to 00:17:53,853
Yeah, I can take out the
guards at the perimeter,
281
00:17:53,893 to 00:17:55,208
signalman, pilot.
282
00:17:55,248 to 00:17:56,697
Hell, I'll just
take 'em all out.
283
00:17:56,823 to 00:17:58,125
What are we
looking at?
284
00:18:01,739 to 00:18:03,703
You have a talent for
sticking your nose in
285
00:18:03,743 to 00:18:05,150
where it doesn't belong.
286
00:18:05,190 to 00:18:06,752
I just couldn't help
but notice
287
00:18:06,792 to 00:18:09,062
you're wearing a uniform
pockfull of laser burns.
288
00:18:09,102 to 00:18:11,613
So either
you heal real quick
289
00:18:11,691 to 00:18:13,800
or you stole it off
a dead man.
290
00:18:13,840 to 00:18:15,975
You're not Imperial Army.
291
00:18:16,063 to 00:18:17,482
You're thieves here
to steal equipment
292
00:18:17,522 to 00:18:19,349
for a job and I want in.
293
00:18:19,841 to 00:18:21,777
Well, now we gotta shoot him.
No.
294
00:18:22,741 to 00:18:24,878
Snap his neck.
It's less mess.
295
00:18:24,952 to 00:18:26,292
Or you take me with you.
296
00:18:26,332 to 00:18:29,044
Look, I came up running scams
on the streets of Corellia.
297
00:18:29,153 to 00:18:31,548
I was boosting AV21s
when I was ten.
298
00:18:31,588 to 00:18:33,428
I'm a driver, a flyer,
299
00:18:33,492 to 00:18:36,918
and hey, you said yourself.
I gotta get outta here. Right?
300
00:18:36,974 to 00:18:39,486
What's a fancy flyboy
doing down in the mud?
301
00:18:40,638 to 00:18:42,753
I got kicked out
of the Imperial Academy
302
00:18:42,836 to 00:18:44,346
for having
a mind of my own.
303
00:18:44,448 to 00:18:47,865
But I am a great pilot.
And I gotta get home.
304
00:18:47,933 to 00:18:50,504
This guy is nuts. No one
goes back to Corellia.
305
00:18:50,561 to 00:18:52,000
I got a reason.
306
00:18:52,070 to 00:18:54,164
We've already
got a great pilot.
307
00:18:54,345 to 00:18:56,793
The Ardennian.
308
00:18:56,833 to 00:18:58,965
Ardennian?
You got a lot of nerve, pal.
309
00:18:59,035 to 00:19:00,428
I'm an Imperial trooper.
310
00:19:00,491 to 00:19:01,671
Oh, really?
A couple of your arms
311
00:19:01,711 to 00:19:02,524
popped out of your butt
312
00:19:02,564 to 00:19:04,294
and hiked up your pants,
trooper.
313
00:19:04,334 to 00:19:05,093
Oh, yeah?
314
00:19:05,133 to 00:19:07,536
Look, I'll do whatever it
takes to get back to Corellia.
315
00:19:07,576 to 00:19:08,796
I've already been away
too long.
316
00:19:08,836 to 00:19:10,755
Just give me a shot.
317
00:19:11,272 to 00:19:12,499
Whoa. Hold it.
318
00:19:14,519 to 00:19:15,985
Well, if you're
not interested in me,
319
00:19:16,025 to 00:19:19,021
I think the lieutenant might
be very interested in you.
320
00:19:22,793 to 00:19:24,095
Blackmail.
321
00:19:26,531 to 00:19:27,499
Lieutenant.
322
00:19:27,539 to 00:19:28,521
Captain.
323
00:19:29,533 to 00:19:32,078
Lieutenant, we have
apprehended a deserter.
324
00:19:32,118 to 00:19:33,026
Take him.
325
00:19:33,066 to 00:19:33,857
Wait.
326
00:19:33,897 to 00:19:36,865
I should've known.
This one's a troublemaker.
327
00:19:36,905 to 00:19:39,098
And a liar. Don't
believe anything he says.
328
00:19:39,138 to 00:19:41,235
Don't go anywhere without me.
All right, let's go.
329
00:19:41,290 to 00:19:42,514
Feed him to the beast.
330
00:19:42,558 to 00:19:44,240
The beast?
Wait, there's a beast?
331
00:19:44,281 to 00:19:45,489
Hold on!
Move it!
332
00:19:45,529 to 00:19:47,745
Listen, that guy's not
even an officer. All right?
333
00:19:47,785 to 00:19:49,043
He was lying!
Quiet!
334
00:19:50,914 to 00:19:51,915
Don't care.
335
00:19:54,791 to 00:19:56,558
Haven't fed him
in three days.
336
00:19:56,598 to 00:19:57,796
Should be fun.
337
00:20:44,398 to 00:20:46,794
Oh! Hey!
Hey, big fella.
338
00:20:46,834 to 00:20:49,542
Just calm down.
Take it easy.
339
00:20:49,652 to 00:20:51,136
We're on the same side.
340
00:20:51,231 to 00:20:52,890
You like treats?
341
00:20:54,469 to 00:20:56,940
Help!
Let me out of here!
342
00:20:56,980 to 00:20:58,149
Let me out of here!
343
00:21:01,652 to 00:21:03,289
Aha! Gotcha!
344
00:21:09,463 to 00:21:10,700
Ahhh!
345
00:21:24,190 to 00:21:25,983
Ah, this was
just getting good.
346
00:21:26,023 to 00:21:27,370
He killed him too fast.
Yeah!
347
00:21:27,410 to 00:21:28,710
Kill him slower.
348
00:21:31,504 to 00:21:32,951
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
349
00:21:32,991 to 00:21:35,553
Wait! Wait!
350
00:21:39,288 to 00:21:40,395
Yeah, I speak a little.
351
00:21:40,435 to 00:21:43,353
Now just listen to me, you...
352
00:22:02,009 to 00:22:03,728
Yes, yes!
353
00:22:04,401 to 00:22:05,637
No, no, no, no!
354
00:22:08,469 to 00:22:09,470
Do it!
355
00:22:09,652 to 00:22:10,756
Come on.
356
00:22:12,432 to 00:22:14,126
Oh, no!
357
00:22:14,487 to 00:22:16,306
Ten credits, he doesn't
last another minute.
358
00:22:16,378 to 00:22:18,206
Let me out of here!
359
00:22:18,325 to 00:22:20,002
I can't take it anymore!
360
00:22:21,154 to 00:22:23,245
Oh, no! Stop, please!
That's it. Get him!
361
00:22:24,054 to 00:22:28,001
You tired, you mangy
Kashyyykian moofmilker?
362
00:22:39,208 to 00:22:41,757
See what happens
when you listen to me?
363
00:22:41,797 to 00:22:43,743
Hey, what are you doing?
364
00:22:46,119 to 00:22:47,787
Ow.
365
00:22:50,961 to 00:22:51,961
Follow me!
366
00:23:03,016 to 00:23:04,264
Wait, wait.
367
00:23:04,304 to 00:23:06,198
Come here.
Listen to me.
368
00:23:06,238 to 00:23:07,196
You don't understand,
okay?
369
00:23:07,236 to 00:23:08,137
I have some
very good friends
370
00:23:08,177 to 00:23:09,281
waiting for me
at that airfield.
371
00:23:09,321 to 00:23:10,718
They're leaving
right now.
372
00:23:10,758 to 00:23:12,437
That's our one way
off this mud ball.
373
00:23:12,477 to 00:23:14,112
If you wanna live,
we go that way.
374
00:23:14,152 to 00:23:16,624
After that, you go whichever
way you want, I don't care!
375
00:23:16,664 to 00:23:18,772
But right now,
that's the way you go!
376
00:23:21,200 to 00:23:22,535
Trust me!
377
00:23:23,139 to 00:23:25,497
Val, let's go!
378
00:23:28,821 to 00:23:31,734
How do they breathe in these
suits? It's so stuffy!
379
00:23:31,992 to 00:23:33,689
No wonder
they're such lousy pilots.
380
00:23:33,729 to 00:23:35,405
You can't turn your head,
you can't breathe,
381
00:23:35,445 to 00:23:36,834
you can't hear each other!
382
00:23:43,771 to 00:23:45,277
I'll be damned.
383
00:23:45,371 to 00:23:46,781
Hey, look who's back!
384
00:23:46,854 to 00:23:48,095
Unbelievable!
385
00:23:48,189 to 00:23:49,907
Wait!
386
00:23:49,947 to 00:23:51,804
Wait!
387
00:23:51,851 to 00:23:54,477
Whoa, is that a Wookiee?
Incredible!
388
00:23:54,517 to 00:23:55,841
I'll say it, I don't care.
389
00:23:55,920 to 00:23:57,415
This kid's growing on me.
390
00:23:57,588 to 00:23:59,388
Wait!
391
00:24:03,294 to 00:24:04,040
You know, we could always use
392
00:24:04,080 to 00:24:06,095
some muscle
on a job like this.
393
00:24:06,329 to 00:24:08,114
Don't even
think about it!
394
00:24:08,190 to 00:24:10,548
I'm telling you, you will
never have a deeper sleep
395
00:24:10,588 to 00:24:12,313
than curled up
in a Wookiee's lap.
396
00:24:18,174 to 00:24:20,930
I told you!
397
00:24:20,970 to 00:24:23,057
Very good friends!
398
00:24:48,250 to 00:24:50,685
We couldn't have done this
maybe, like, one at a time?
399
00:25:18,856 to 00:25:20,590
Thanks for helping me
get outta there.
400
00:25:26,945 to 00:25:28,879
No, they only took you
because of me.
401
00:25:30,059 to 00:25:31,201
Hey!
402
00:25:31,321 to 00:25:33,952
I got us
a real sweet deal here.
403
00:25:34,047 to 00:25:36,006
We do this one job
with them,
404
00:25:36,115 to 00:25:37,910
we make some real money,
405
00:25:38,104 to 00:25:40,112
and then we're free.
406
00:25:40,396 to 00:25:42,263
When's the last time
you could say that?
407
00:25:45,700 to 00:25:47,970
Been a while
for me, too.
408
00:25:49,397 to 00:25:51,694
So what's your name,
anyway?
409
00:25:55,036 to 00:25:57,463
Chewbacca?
410
00:25:57,559 to 00:25:59,847
All right, well, you're gonna
need a nickname,
411
00:25:59,926 to 00:26:01,661
'cause I ain't saying that
every time.
412
00:26:07,471 to 00:26:08,922
Here it comes.
Take a look.
413
00:26:08,962 to 00:26:09,604
Yeah.
414
00:26:09,644 to 00:26:13,539
We hit the Conveyex between
the tower and the bridge.
415
00:26:13,601 to 00:26:16,780
Rio drops us in, we separate
the payload container,
416
00:26:16,820 to 00:26:19,410
cable it up to the AThauler
and then...
417
00:26:19,451 to 00:26:21,304
Rio jams
their distress signal.
418
00:26:21,986 to 00:26:23,086
I blow the bridge,
419
00:26:23,126 to 00:26:25,019
the container slides
right off the track
420
00:26:25,059 to 00:26:26,473
and we sail away.
421
00:26:26,513 to 00:26:28,276
You trip that security beam,
422
00:26:28,316 to 00:26:29,439
wake up those Vipers,
423
00:26:29,479 to 00:26:31,901
it's liable to get
real spicy, real fast.
424
00:26:31,963 to 00:26:34,083
Well, I'm not the one
you should be worried about.
425
00:26:34,201 to 00:26:35,583
Enfys Nest.
426
00:26:35,677 to 00:26:37,041
What's an Enfys Nest?
427
00:26:37,117 to 00:26:38,212
I told you,
we're way ahead
428
00:26:38,252 to 00:26:40,035
of the competition
on this one.
429
00:26:40,097 to 00:26:41,293
There's no way Enfys Nest
430
00:26:41,333 to 00:26:43,395
even knows
about this shipment.
431
00:26:43,561 to 00:26:45,158
Only my guy
has the intel.
432
00:26:45,198 to 00:26:47,687
Well, you better
be right. Yeah?
433
00:26:47,763 to 00:26:49,900
Because sometimes,
you put your faith
434
00:26:49,990 to 00:26:51,324
in the wrong people.
435
00:26:53,559 to 00:26:56,049
Our whole future
depends on this one score
436
00:26:56,089 to 00:26:57,407
and you bring in amateurs.
437
00:26:57,462 to 00:26:58,689
In case you hadn't noticed,
438
00:26:58,729 to 00:27:00,371
we're a little shorthanded.
439
00:27:00,441 to 00:27:01,895
So we get who we need.
440
00:27:01,966 to 00:27:04,423
The Xan sisters, or Bossk.
441
00:27:04,483 to 00:27:06,753
But, no, instead you're
putting our lives
442
00:27:06,793 to 00:27:08,369
in the hands of morons.
443
00:27:09,412 to 00:27:10,740
You guys morons?
444
00:27:10,819 to 00:27:11,631
No!
445
00:27:11,671 to 00:27:13,817
No. See?
We're not morons.
446
00:27:13,857 to 00:27:16,831
Look, I waited a long time
for a shot like this.
447
00:27:16,871 to 00:27:18,677
I'm not about to screw it up,
all right?
448
00:27:19,507 to 00:27:20,636
Oh, come on, Val!
449
00:27:20,708 to 00:27:22,313
He looks so sincere.
450
00:27:22,360 to 00:27:23,723
Plus, have you ever
tried to disinvite
451
00:27:23,763 to 00:27:24,859
a Wookiee to anything?
452
00:27:24,899 to 00:27:27,429
Not a good idea!
453
00:27:27,510 to 00:27:28,819
This is not funny!
454
00:27:28,984 to 00:27:33,348
Look, now, I have great
instincts about these guys.
455
00:27:33,672 to 00:27:37,260
And, besides,
do you see any other options?
456
00:27:37,300 to 00:27:38,648
I just hope you know
what you're doing.
457
00:27:38,688 to 00:27:41,452
Yeah, I know exactly
what I'm doing and why.
458
00:27:41,518 to 00:27:43,344
We're gonna
clear our debts,
459
00:27:43,384 to 00:27:45,297
go back to Glee Anselm,
460
00:27:46,253 to 00:27:49,016
and I'm finally gonna learn
how to play that valachord.
461
00:27:49,056 to 00:27:51,228
Babe, you're never gonna learn
how to play the valachord.
462
00:27:51,268 to 00:27:53,096
She's right.
You are tonedeaf.
463
00:27:56,661 to 00:27:59,028
So what's your sob story,
flyboy?
464
00:27:59,068 to 00:27:59,942
Who, me?
465
00:27:59,982 to 00:28:01,978
You're after something,
I know the look.
466
00:28:02,018 to 00:28:03,674
What is it?
Revenge?
467
00:28:04,648 to 00:28:06,145
No, it's not revenge.
468
00:28:06,411 to 00:28:07,739
Look at him.
469
00:28:07,865 to 00:28:09,426
If it's anything,
it's a girl.
470
00:28:09,466 to 00:28:10,447
Oh, a girl!
471
00:28:10,487 to 00:28:13,053
Tell us about the girl, Han.
Is she nice?
472
00:28:13,648 to 00:28:15,312
Does she have sharp teeth?
473
00:28:18,592 to 00:28:19,794
There was a girl.
474
00:28:20,143 to 00:28:23,431
But I got out,
she didn't.
475
00:28:25,352 to 00:28:28,149
I swore to myself
I'd become a pilot,
476
00:28:28,471 to 00:28:30,236
get a ship,
477
00:28:30,341 to 00:28:31,623
go back and find her.
478
00:28:32,760 to 00:28:36,518
That's what I'm gonna do
right after this job.
479
00:28:36,589 to 00:28:38,624
How you know
she'll still be there?
480
00:28:39,522 to 00:28:41,147
I just know.
481
00:28:41,225 to 00:28:42,565
Personally, I refuse
to be tied down
482
00:28:42,605 to 00:28:44,766
by anyone,
though many have tried.
483
00:28:44,806 to 00:28:47,636
Come on, Rio.
You don't fool me.
484
00:28:47,775 to 00:28:49,489
Everybody needs somebody.
485
00:28:50,467 to 00:28:54,003
Even a broken down
old crook like this one.
486
00:29:04,864 to 00:29:06,714
How about you? What are you
gonna do with your share?
487
00:29:19,683 to 00:29:20,959
What was he saying?
488
00:29:20,999 to 00:29:22,403
He said the Wookiees
were enslaved
489
00:29:22,443 to 00:29:24,976
by the Empire,
taken off Kashyyyk.
490
00:29:25,147 to 00:29:26,991
He's searching
for his, uh...
491
00:29:28,303 to 00:29:30,438
I don't know if he said
tribe or family.
492
00:29:31,778 to 00:29:33,086
What's the difference?
493
00:29:36,213 to 00:29:37,709
Show me how to do that.
494
00:29:37,891 to 00:29:40,118
The only thing
you need to learn to do
495
00:29:42,669 to 00:29:45,441
is do what I say
when I say it.
496
00:29:45,698 to 00:29:47,527
And this time tomorrow,
497
00:29:47,567 to 00:29:48,802
you'll have
more than enough
498
00:29:48,842 to 00:29:50,244
to buy your own ship.
499
00:30:11,969 to 00:30:13,491
Starting the clock.
500
00:30:13,531 to 00:30:16,232
Jamming their signal.
9.6 to the bridge.
501
00:30:16,272 to 00:30:18,676
Let's find out how good
we really are, folks.
502
00:30:30,360 to 00:30:31,275
I'm fine!
503
00:30:35,576 to 00:30:37,259
Val, how's it going
up there?
504
00:30:41,434 to 00:30:42,569
Never better.
505
00:31:05,729 to 00:31:07,132
Coaxium.
506
00:31:07,514 to 00:31:09,456
Enough to power a fleet!
507
00:31:09,496 to 00:31:12,002
Or blow us all
straight to hell!
508
00:31:14,630 to 00:31:15,964
All right, talk to me.
509
00:31:16,185 to 00:31:17,413
Is it a good day?
510
00:31:17,624 to 00:31:19,219
It's a great day!
511
00:31:19,259 to 00:31:21,822
Best day of your life,
my grabby friend!
512
00:31:21,892 to 00:31:23,019
I don't know,
you've never been
513
00:31:23,059 to 00:31:24,848
to a Mynock roast
on Ardennia.
514
00:31:24,888 to 00:31:25,990
It's nuts!
515
00:31:28,612 to 00:31:29,806
Here they come!
516
00:31:29,901 to 00:31:31,595
Get down to the couplers!
517
00:31:31,643 to 00:31:33,196
Rio, fall back!
518
00:31:33,236 to 00:31:34,573
Well, that didn't
take 'em long.
519
00:31:52,882 to 00:31:53,851
Chewie!
520
00:32:10,185 to 00:32:11,948
You all right?
521
00:32:11,988 to 00:32:13,789
Little close there,
buddy!
522
00:32:18,209 to 00:32:19,920
Han, what's the holdup?
523
00:32:20,764 to 00:32:22,040
All right, together.
524
00:32:24,531 to 00:32:25,858
Now!
525
00:32:30,881 to 00:32:32,850
All right!
526
00:32:33,644 to 00:32:34,644
Oh!
527
00:32:38,751 to 00:32:41,192
They got one uncoupled.
Where are you, buddy?
528
00:32:41,265 to 00:32:43,096
Just up here
planning my retirement.
529
00:32:43,098 to 00:32:44,384
Thinking about opening
a cantina
530
00:32:44,386 to 00:32:46,756
somewhere warm
but not too warm, you know?
531
00:32:46,830 to 00:32:49,167
Lowering
the winch cables now!
532
00:33:05,897 to 00:33:07,960
I knew it! I told him!
Beckett!
533
00:33:08,034 to 00:33:09,202
He's coming!
534
00:33:10,715 to 00:33:13,245
Damn it! I'm never gonna
hear the end of this!
535
00:33:17,993 to 00:33:19,221
Who's that?
536
00:33:19,354 to 00:33:20,815
Enfys Nest!
537
00:33:20,817 to 00:33:22,608
Marauders, pirates.
538
00:33:22,610 to 00:33:24,440
Come to snake the score
from under us.
539
00:33:25,468 to 00:33:27,203
Ready your harpoons.
540
00:33:27,205 to 00:33:28,206
Move in.
541
00:34:08,708 to 00:34:11,103
Hang on!
I got an uninvited guest.
542
00:34:11,189 to 00:34:14,547
Get off of my ship!
543
00:34:18,732 to 00:34:20,614
You still with us, brother?
544
00:34:20,670 to 00:34:22,571
Yeah, I'm okay.
545
00:34:22,629 to 00:34:24,631
Just nicked one of my shoulders.
It's nothing.
546
00:34:25,212 to 00:34:26,406
He's not okay.
547
00:34:33,643 to 00:34:35,027
Chewie!
548
00:34:35,119 to 00:34:37,395
You gotta uncouple this one
on your own!
549
00:34:42,842 to 00:34:44,168
Han!
550
00:34:44,318 to 00:34:45,485
I'm on it!
551
00:34:55,613 to 00:34:56,187
Val!
552
00:34:56,189 to 00:34:59,179
Keep your eyes open.
We just tripped a sensor.
553
00:35:04,660 to 00:35:06,227
Viper droids
headed your way!
554
00:35:07,369 to 00:35:09,397
Rio?
555
00:35:09,593 to 00:35:11,612
Yeah, it looks worse
than it is.
556
00:35:12,169 to 00:35:14,364
Just gotta patch it up.
557
00:35:14,404 to 00:35:16,772
Maybe rest my eyes
for a minute.
558
00:35:36,967 to 00:35:38,943
Enough!
I'm going in.
559
00:36:04,313 to 00:36:05,648
You weren't lying, kid.
560
00:36:06,989 to 00:36:08,684
You're a hell of a pilot.
561
00:36:08,724 to 00:36:10,079
Rio, stay with me, buddy.
562
00:36:23,074 to 00:36:25,021
Beckett,
we just lost a cable!
563
00:36:26,136 to 00:36:28,007
2.1 to the bridge!
564
00:36:32,078 to 00:36:33,744
It's no good
to die alone, kid.
565
00:36:35,489 to 00:36:36,750
Val was right.
566
00:36:39,387 to 00:36:40,515
Rio?
567
00:37:11,322 to 00:37:13,011
Beckett, we're .8
from the bridge!
568
00:37:13,052 to 00:37:15,214
Val's still on the track!
569
00:37:15,254 to 00:37:17,452
Val, you gotta
get off that bridge!
570
00:37:17,454 to 00:37:18,355
We're here!
571
00:37:22,870 to 00:37:24,557
They got me pinned!
572
00:37:24,627 to 00:37:26,778
I'm gonna have to finish
the job from right here.
573
00:37:26,933 to 00:37:28,420
What?
574
00:37:28,497 to 00:37:30,099
It's been a ride, babe.
575
00:37:31,703 to 00:37:33,671
And I wouldn't trade it
for anything.
576
00:37:34,478 to 00:37:35,397
Val!
577
00:37:35,467 to 00:37:36,668
No!
578
00:37:42,114 to 00:37:44,547
No!
579
00:37:58,129 to 00:38:00,004
Chewie, now!
580
00:38:22,323 to 00:38:24,551
Beckett, I can't
pull it away from 'em.
581
00:38:25,288 to 00:38:27,689
They'll let go,
you fly straight!
582
00:38:29,963 to 00:38:31,556
Release your cables
583
00:38:31,731 to 00:38:33,032
or die!
584
00:38:34,305 to 00:38:35,019
We're too close.
585
00:38:35,021 to 00:38:36,149
I gotta release.
586
00:38:36,151 to 00:38:37,625
You do what
I tell you, Han!
587
00:38:37,627 to 00:38:39,078
Chewie, grab the line!
588
00:38:39,168 to 00:38:40,509
Don't you do it!
589
00:38:43,805 to 00:38:45,001
Han!
590
00:38:45,041 to 00:38:46,607
You coward!
591
00:39:35,223 to 00:39:36,707
What the hell?
592
00:39:36,998 to 00:39:40,439
You don't listen
and you can't follow orders!
593
00:39:40,565 to 00:39:42,907
You have any idea
what you've done?
594
00:39:43,024 to 00:39:45,811
We were not stealing
for ourselves,
595
00:39:45,813 to 00:39:48,427
we were hired
by Crimson Dawn.
596
00:39:50,788 to 00:39:53,050
Crimson Dawn?
597
00:39:53,052 to 00:39:55,409
Now we owe them 100 keys
of refined coaxium.
598
00:39:55,411 to 00:39:57,607
When they find out
we don't got it,
599
00:39:57,910 to 00:39:59,677
they're gonna kill us.
600
00:40:00,744 to 00:40:02,372
Right.
601
00:40:02,616 to 00:40:03,797
We run.
602
00:40:03,844 to 00:40:06,707
I'm already a deserter.
What's the difference?
603
00:40:07,020 to 00:40:08,047
The difference
604
00:40:08,049 to 00:40:09,706
is the Empire
doesn't send out
605
00:40:09,708 to 00:40:12,042
a team of enforcers
to hunt you down
606
00:40:12,125 to 00:40:13,564
when you're a deserter.
607
00:40:13,643 to 00:40:15,076
Dryden Vos will.
608
00:40:17,151 to 00:40:18,171
You have any idea
what it's like
609
00:40:18,173 to 00:40:20,110
to live with a price
on your head?
610
00:40:21,690 to 00:40:24,359
The only thing to do
is to go to them.
611
00:40:24,446 to 00:40:26,816
Maybe I can find some way
to make it up to him.
612
00:40:31,380 to 00:40:32,814
Then that's what we do.
613
00:40:37,621 to 00:40:38,821
No.
614
00:40:42,986 to 00:40:45,323
He knows me,
not you.
615
00:40:46,332 to 00:40:48,667
If you come with me
616
00:40:49,316 to 00:40:51,611
and show your face,
617
00:40:51,613 to 00:40:53,447
if they don't kill you,
618
00:40:55,001 to 00:40:57,105
you're in this life for good.
619
00:40:59,360 to 00:41:02,195
You find some way
to square this,
620
00:41:04,139 to 00:41:05,975
we still get our money?
621
00:41:07,783 to 00:41:09,183
Maybe.
622
00:41:11,665 to 00:41:14,001
For me,
it's worth the risk.
623
00:41:16,663 to 00:41:17,663
How about you?
624
00:41:24,837 to 00:41:26,505
That's yes.
625
00:41:28,385 to 00:41:31,615
Sorry I punched your face.
626
00:41:31,834 to 00:41:34,003
Happens more often
than you think.
627
00:41:36,138 to 00:41:37,024
So when we get up there,
628
00:41:37,026 to 00:41:39,303
Dryden Vos is waiting for us
at Fort Ypso?
629
00:41:39,383 to 00:41:42,462
Nearby,
on his yacht.
630
00:41:42,528 to 00:41:44,522
You're gonna know
how to find it?
631
00:41:44,601 to 00:41:46,171
That won't be
a problem.
632
00:42:27,518 to 00:42:30,121
I'll need to
check your weapons.
633
00:42:31,488 to 00:42:32,967
That's all I got left.
634
00:43:13,475 to 00:43:16,367
I'm here to see Dryden.
He's expecting me.
635
00:43:16,474 to 00:43:17,797
He'll be with you
shortly.
636
00:43:17,799 to 00:43:19,962
He's just finishing
with the regional governor.
637
00:43:25,215 to 00:43:26,479
Excuse me, sir.
638
00:43:26,481 to 00:43:27,543
Yes.
639
00:43:27,632 to 00:43:30,519
Beckett has arrived.
Oh.
640
00:43:32,642 to 00:43:36,221
Put this in my office.
I might be needing it later.
641
00:43:42,676 to 00:43:45,205
I get all worked up.
Silly.
642
00:43:45,480 to 00:43:46,780
It's a party.
643
00:43:50,238 to 00:43:51,408
Hey.
644
00:43:51,410 to 00:43:54,568
These people are
not your friends
645
00:43:54,694 to 00:43:57,325
and they're never gonna be,
so don't talk to any of 'em.
646
00:43:57,397 to 00:43:58,526
Don't look at anybody,
647
00:43:58,528 to 00:44:00,355
just keep your eyes down.
648
00:44:04,149 to 00:44:05,702
I might get a drink.
649
00:44:18,488 to 00:44:19,963
No, yeah, whatever.
650
00:44:38,319 to 00:44:40,787
Chewie, would you please...
651
00:44:49,903 to 00:44:51,664
Qi'ra, what are you
doing here?
652
00:44:51,666 to 00:44:53,028
I work here.
653
00:44:53,303 to 00:44:55,064
What's your excuse?
654
00:44:55,066 to 00:44:56,395
My... I...
655
00:44:56,397 to 00:44:58,067
Qi'ra, I was...
656
00:45:00,673 to 00:45:02,775
I was coming back
for you.
657
00:45:03,457 to 00:45:05,300
It's in the past, Han.
658
00:45:05,388 to 00:45:05,927
Not for me.
659
00:45:05,967 to 00:45:06,893
The only reason I'm here,
660
00:45:06,895 to 00:45:08,497
I was doing this job,
get a little money
661
00:45:08,548 to 00:45:11,238
and then I was gonna come back
to Corellia and find you.
662
00:45:11,315 to 00:45:13,383
Well, now you don't have to.
663
00:45:14,414 to 00:45:16,382
I'm right in front of you.
664
00:45:18,599 to 00:45:19,891
That day...
665
00:45:19,946 to 00:45:21,641
Sometimes,
a lot of times, I think...
666
00:45:21,643 to 00:45:22,944
If you'd have stayed,
667
00:45:24,156 to 00:45:26,226
they would've killed you.
668
00:45:27,651 to 00:45:29,652
I'm glad you got out.
669
00:45:33,992 to 00:45:35,393
How did you get out?
670
00:45:39,156 to 00:45:41,025
I didn't.
671
00:45:44,227 to 00:45:45,981
You look good.
672
00:45:46,003 to 00:45:47,763
A little rough
around the edges,
673
00:45:47,860 to 00:45:49,162
but good.
674
00:45:49,705 to 00:45:50,808
You too.
675
00:45:51,547 to 00:45:52,743
Thank you, Ottilie.
676
00:45:53,578 to 00:45:55,375
Have you been attentive
to DokOndar?
677
00:45:55,377 to 00:45:56,445
Very.
678
00:45:59,893 to 00:46:01,922
What should we drink to?
679
00:46:02,300 to 00:46:05,170
Let's drink two
and see where it goes.
680
00:46:13,181 to 00:46:15,864
Did you ever get that ship
we were going to fly away on?
681
00:46:15,887 to 00:46:18,050
Yeah.
Sort of.
682
00:46:18,119 to 00:46:20,402
About to.
That's why I'm here.
683
00:46:20,461 to 00:46:22,778
I'm working on a...
684
00:46:22,780 to 00:46:24,737
Very big deal.
685
00:46:24,764 to 00:46:25,891
How big?
686
00:46:26,081 to 00:46:27,091
Enormous.
687
00:46:27,146 to 00:46:30,676
Really? And when are you going
to close this enormous deal?
688
00:46:30,791 to 00:46:32,359
Any minute.
689
00:46:33,743 to 00:46:36,041
I thought
about you a lot.
690
00:46:36,102 to 00:46:39,317
Off somewhere,
some adventure.
691
00:46:39,411 to 00:46:42,448
I imagined myself with you.
It always made me...
692
00:46:45,449 to 00:46:47,179
What?
Hey.
693
00:46:47,305 to 00:46:49,301
What did I say?
694
00:46:49,355 to 00:46:51,394
Look, I can't keep my eyes
down the whole time.
695
00:46:51,474 to 00:46:52,870
I'm gonna
bump into something.
696
00:46:52,912 to 00:46:54,209
But I told you
not to talk to anyone.
697
00:46:54,276 to 00:46:55,277
Beckett.
698
00:46:56,164 to 00:46:59,034
Wait.
You two work together?
699
00:47:00,139 to 00:47:01,408
Yeah.
Tobias!
700
00:47:03,320 to 00:47:05,047
Dryden.
701
00:47:05,096 to 00:47:07,103
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
702
00:47:07,105 to 00:47:08,973
No, I'm fine.
703
00:47:09,997 to 00:47:11,692
I'm sorry
to hear about Val.
704
00:47:11,787 to 00:47:13,148
Yeah,
I appreciate that.
705
00:47:13,225 to 00:47:14,492
But there was no way
we could've anticipated...
706
00:47:14,494 to 00:47:17,054
I don't believe
we've been introduced.
707
00:47:17,056 to 00:47:20,105
Yeah. This is Han Solo
and Chewbacca.
708
00:47:20,107 to 00:47:21,701
They're with me.
709
00:47:21,703 to 00:47:23,431
I'm Dryden Vos.
710
00:47:23,712 to 00:47:27,293
I see you've already met
my top lieutenant.
711
00:47:29,729 to 00:47:31,908
Han and I grew up
together on Corellia.
712
00:47:32,594 to 00:47:35,001
Oh, fellow scrumrat.
713
00:47:35,099 to 00:47:38,431
I admire anyone who can crawl
their way out of the sewer.
714
00:47:38,564 to 00:47:41,347
Especially,
a sewer as putrid as Corellia.
715
00:47:41,417 to 00:47:43,411
The stench, am I right?
716
00:47:44,550 to 00:47:46,049
Well, it's good
to have you.
717
00:47:46,224 to 00:47:47,959
Welcome.
718
00:47:48,007 to 00:47:50,341
And you, too, Chewbacca,
welcome.
719
00:47:51,004 to 00:47:55,040
All right, let's eat a
little, drink a lot,
720
00:47:55,042 to 00:47:56,385
and talk privately.
721
00:47:59,581 to 00:48:00,989
We're just friends,
all right?
722
00:48:00,991 to 00:48:02,917
You're touchy.
723
00:48:03,805 to 00:48:07,477
Beckett, you have
put me in a terrible position.
724
00:48:07,528 to 00:48:09,608
I know, Dryden,
and I am sorry.
725
00:48:09,667 to 00:48:10,592
You're sorry?
726
00:48:10,630 to 00:48:12,092
Dryden, there were
complications.
727
00:48:12,094 to 00:48:12,883
There were factors.
728
00:48:12,885 to 00:48:16,305
Enfys Nest has been
a constant irritation forever.
729
00:48:16,307 to 00:48:17,913
It's one you should've
anticipated,
730
00:48:17,915 to 00:48:19,476
it's one you should've
dealt with.
731
00:48:19,478 to 00:48:20,964
Trust me, I know
I made a mistake,
732
00:48:21,033 to 00:48:23,955
but when you hired me,
you told me
733
00:48:23,957 to 00:48:24,955
no one else
had this information...
734
00:48:24,957 to 00:48:26,346
Test me!
735
00:48:27,417 to 00:48:30,314
Test me one more time,
you'll see what happens.
736
00:48:30,386 to 00:48:32,773
I think what Dryden
is trying to say
737
00:48:32,775 to 00:48:35,706
is that we're not interested
in why you don't have it.
738
00:48:35,913 to 00:48:37,767
No, I'm not interested.
739
00:48:37,769 to 00:48:39,577
I'm not interested
at all.
740
00:48:39,766 to 00:48:40,838
Dryden,
741
00:48:40,840 to 00:48:42,814
what can I do
to make this right?
742
00:48:42,894 to 00:48:44,722
"Make this right?"
743
00:48:44,994 to 00:48:47,189
There is no
making this right.
744
00:48:47,433 to 00:48:48,719
You know who I answer to
745
00:48:48,721 to 00:48:51,074
and you know
what he'll expect of me.
746
00:48:51,076 to 00:48:53,212
He'll say, "There have
to be consequences."
747
00:48:53,214 to 00:48:56,938
So here's what I need you
to do for me.
748
00:48:57,066 to 00:49:00,600
I need you to give me
a reason
749
00:49:01,062 to 00:49:03,706
not to kill you all.
750
00:49:03,755 to 00:49:05,666
Because I will
make it up to you.
751
00:49:05,668 to 00:49:06,945
No, no, no. How?
752
00:49:06,947 to 00:49:08,231
How will you
make it up to me?
753
00:49:08,233 to 00:49:11,632
By delivering exactly
what was promised.
754
00:49:12,444 to 00:49:15,298
100 kgrams of
refined coaxium?
755
00:49:15,300 to 00:49:18,734
Yes. We will simply steal it
from somewhere else.
756
00:49:18,736 to 00:49:20,165
From where?
757
00:49:20,246 to 00:49:21,375
You'll be hard pushed
to find that
758
00:49:21,377 to 00:49:23,051
anywhere outside
an Imperial vault.
759
00:49:23,053 to 00:49:25,048
Scarif.
Maybe Mercy Island.
760
00:49:25,050 to 00:49:26,384
That's impossible.
761
00:49:26,386 to 00:49:29,082
So, let's come up
with some other options.
762
00:49:29,149 to 00:49:30,444
Other ideas
that we might...
763
00:49:30,446 to 00:49:32,349
What about unrefined?
764
00:49:35,504 to 00:49:38,555
Well, the only known
source of astatic coaxium
765
00:49:38,602 to 00:49:41,550
is a fissure vent beneath
the spice mines on Kessel.
766
00:49:41,552 to 00:49:43,785
Yeah. That's the one
I was thinking of.
767
00:49:43,787 to 00:49:45,417
That's a very,
very good one.
768
00:49:45,496 to 00:49:47,709
But see,
the Pykes control Kessel.
769
00:49:47,762 to 00:49:48,784
Crimson Dawn maintains
770
00:49:48,826 to 00:49:51,121
a fragile alliance
with the Pykes.
771
00:49:51,210 to 00:49:53,486
It's one that
I can't jeopardize
772
00:49:53,488 to 00:49:55,616
without risking an allout
war with the Syndicates,
773
00:49:55,618 to 00:49:58,795
and that, gentlemen,
I will not do.
774
00:49:58,984 to 00:50:02,590
So, if that's all you have,
I think we're done here.
775
00:50:02,592 to 00:50:03,452
Not all we have.
776
00:50:03,454 to 00:50:06,484
We don't have any alliance
with the Pykes.
777
00:50:06,486 to 00:50:08,954
Right, so nobody is gonna know
we're working for you.
778
00:50:18,940 to 00:50:19,940
Possible?
779
00:50:20,405 to 00:50:21,667
It's risky.
780
00:50:21,669 to 00:50:24,366
As soon as the raw coaxium
is removed from the vault,
781
00:50:24,368 to 00:50:26,021
it starts to destabilize,
782
00:50:26,023 to 00:50:27,656
so unless...
783
00:50:27,658 to 00:50:29,187
Unless...
784
00:50:29,518 to 00:50:30,785
Unless...
785
00:50:31,411 to 00:50:32,539
Work with me here.
786
00:50:32,541 to 00:50:34,327
Unless you could
find somewhere
787
00:50:34,329 to 00:50:36,029
to get it processed fast.
788
00:50:36,031 to 00:50:37,313
Uh...
Uh...
789
00:50:38,220 to 00:50:39,521
Well...
790
00:50:40,511 to 00:50:41,874
He's saying Savareen?
791
00:50:42,093 to 00:50:43,225
Savareen.
792
00:50:43,227 to 00:50:45,132
Yeah,
it's an old refinery there
793
00:50:45,134 to 00:50:47,315
and it's not under
Imperial jurisdiction.
794
00:50:47,401 to 00:50:49,058
But Qi'ra's right.
795
00:50:49,120 to 00:50:52,550
The canisters will explode
before you get there,
796
00:50:52,552 to 00:50:54,932
so you'd need
an incredibly fast ship
797
00:50:54,988 to 00:50:56,641
and a brilliant pilot.
798
00:50:56,755 to 00:50:58,289
We'll find a ship.
799
00:50:58,291 to 00:51:00,001
We've already
got the pilot.
800
00:51:04,686 to 00:51:08,449
He is arrogant
and he's hungry.
801
00:51:08,480 to 00:51:09,435
So what do you think,
my dear?
802
00:51:09,437 to 00:51:14,235
You think your friend here
can do what needs to be done?
803
00:51:20,758 to 00:51:22,726
Yes, I believe he can.
804
00:51:24,340 to 00:51:25,628
Well, that is good news,
805
00:51:25,630 to 00:51:27,625
because you're going with him
806
00:51:27,920 to 00:51:30,191
to see that he does.
807
00:51:31,541 to 00:51:33,408
All right?
808
00:51:34,634 to 00:51:35,636
Of course.
809
00:51:37,252 to 00:51:38,815
All right.
810
00:51:38,866 to 00:51:40,526
I'll see you all
on Savareen.
811
00:51:40,634 to 00:51:41,654
Savareen it is.
812
00:51:41,708 to 00:51:43,497
I feel great about this plan.
Me, too.
813
00:51:43,499 to 00:51:45,224
We should do this again.
It's been fun.
814
00:51:45,756 to 00:51:46,273
Great.
815
00:51:46,275 to 00:51:47,937
Oh, just one more thing.
816
00:51:48,509 to 00:51:50,274
If you do fail me again,
817
00:51:51,916 to 00:51:53,461
we'll all be out of options.
818
00:51:54,065 to 00:51:55,135
Right?
819
00:51:55,137 to 00:51:56,204
We won't.
820
00:51:59,239 to 00:52:02,055
So, I thought
that went really well.
821
00:52:02,107 to 00:52:04,347
Let's get this done as quick
and as clean as possible.
822
00:52:04,349 to 00:52:05,234
What do you need?
823
00:52:05,236 to 00:52:06,994
I can scrounge up
the gear.
824
00:52:06,996 to 00:52:08,508
Do you got a line
on a ship?
825
00:52:08,713 to 00:52:09,747
I know a guy.
826
00:52:11,004 to 00:52:13,467
And I know
just where to find him.
827
00:52:13,469 to 00:52:15,527
It's a long shot,
but it's worth a try.
828
00:52:15,631 to 00:52:16,896
He's the best
smuggler around.
829
00:52:16,898 to 00:52:18,050
He's slipped through
the Empire's fingers
830
00:52:18,052 to 00:52:20,181
more times than anyone else.
831
00:52:20,653 to 00:52:22,996
He's attractive, too.
832
00:52:22,998 to 00:52:23,960
Sophisticated,
833
00:52:23,962 to 00:52:27,764
with impeccable taste
and... Charisma.
834
00:52:29,596 to 00:52:31,862
Not to mention
his prodigious...
835
00:52:31,942 to 00:52:32,944
We get it.
836
00:52:37,556 to 00:52:40,710
But he's retired.
Says he's a sportsman now.
837
00:52:40,712 to 00:52:42,472
All we need is his ship.
838
00:52:42,587 to 00:52:44,298
Well, he'll never
part with it.
839
00:52:44,300 to 00:52:45,480
He loves that ship.
840
00:52:45,482 to 00:52:46,949
He won it
841
00:52:47,682 to 00:52:48,626
playing Sabacc.
842
00:52:48,628 to 00:52:49,906
And there's the rub, right?
843
00:52:49,908 to 00:52:52,020
How was I supposed to know
she was an Imperial spy?
844
00:52:52,022 to 00:52:54,217
I thought she loved me.
845
00:52:54,312 to 00:52:55,750
That's the guy, huh?
846
00:52:55,752 to 00:52:57,113
Hmm.
847
00:52:57,610 to 00:52:59,308
An interesting style.
848
00:52:59,583 to 00:53:00,585
I'll say.
849
00:53:01,374 to 00:53:02,506
You say he won his ship?
850
00:53:02,508 to 00:53:04,623
You have an awful Sabacc face.
I'm gonna call it.
851
00:53:04,625 to 00:53:06,262
I can take him.
Let me at him.
852
00:53:06,264 to 00:53:07,726
Absolutely not.
853
00:53:07,728 to 00:53:09,789
Han, these guys
are serious gamblers.
854
00:53:09,850 to 00:53:11,946
I'm serious. Stake me.
855
00:53:11,948 to 00:53:14,353
Don't listen to him.
856
00:53:20,736 to 00:53:22,811
Thank you. Thank you.
857
00:53:22,813 to 00:53:24,582
You see, how'd you guys
let me beat you on that one?
858
00:53:24,584 to 00:53:25,585
Come on.
859
00:53:26,904 to 00:53:29,020
There's no liars in this game,
just players.
860
00:53:29,143 to 00:53:30,612
Is this seat taken?
861
00:53:33,596 to 00:53:36,039
If nobody's in the seat,
then it ain't taken, friend.
862
00:53:39,104 to 00:53:41,598
So this is, uh, Sabacc?
863
00:53:41,919 to 00:53:42,752
Sabacc.
864
00:53:42,754 to 00:53:45,385
Sabacc. Got it.
865
00:53:45,439 to 00:53:46,633
You play it before?
866
00:53:46,914 to 00:53:48,406
A couple times, yeah.
867
00:53:49,919 to 00:53:51,376
Captain Lando Calrissian.
868
00:53:51,409 to 00:53:53,227
Han Solo.
869
00:53:53,229 to 00:53:55,157
Looks like you're
having a good day.
870
00:53:55,382 to 00:53:56,436
I'm a lucky guy.
871
00:53:57,546 to 00:54:00,226
Can I ask you a question,
Captain Calrissian?
872
00:54:00,437 to 00:54:01,781
Anything, Han.
873
00:54:02,069 to 00:54:05,450
That's "Han",
but that's okay.
874
00:54:05,452 to 00:54:09,089
I heard a story about you.
I was wondering if it's true.
875
00:54:10,245 to 00:54:13,845
Everything you've heard
about me is true.
876
00:54:13,992 to 00:54:14,972
Thanks, love.
877
00:54:14,974 to 00:54:17,302
Did you win your ship
playing cards?
878
00:54:17,304 to 00:54:18,888
Oh, I've won
a lot of things.
879
00:54:20,479 to 00:54:23,543
I once won a subtropical moon
in the Oseon Belt.
880
00:54:23,921 to 00:54:24,748
Wow.
881
00:54:24,750 to 00:54:26,876
Turned out to be
a real money pit.
882
00:54:26,954 to 00:54:27,606
I'm impressed.
883
00:54:27,646 to 00:54:28,908
I don't think I'd have
the nerve to gamble
884
00:54:28,910 to 00:54:31,204
with something
I love as much as my ship.
885
00:54:31,248 to 00:54:32,810
Really?
Yeah.
886
00:54:33,241 to 00:54:34,275
What do you fly?
887
00:54:34,981 to 00:54:36,783
VCX100.
888
00:54:38,304 to 00:54:40,208
That is a quality ship.
Right, boys?
889
00:54:40,302 to 00:54:42,065
It's the fastest
in the galaxy,
890
00:54:42,067 to 00:54:43,496
but there's a lot of
great ships out there.
891
00:54:43,498 to 00:54:45,901
I mean, I'm sure
yours is very nice.
892
00:54:46,055 to 00:54:47,924
Gets me where I'm goin'.
893
00:54:52,317 to 00:54:53,551
Beginner's luck.
894
00:54:53,642 to 00:54:55,444
Well played.
895
00:55:02,574 to 00:55:04,570
Let's see what
we got here.
896
00:55:04,572 to 00:55:06,365
Oh, great hand!
897
00:55:10,061 to 00:55:13,058
Sorry, guys.
Close, but not quite.
898
00:55:22,671 to 00:55:24,840
Eyes on
your own cards, buddy.
899
00:55:25,399 to 00:55:27,007
All of 'em.
900
00:55:27,009 to 00:55:28,933
There.
Well, now I see yours.
901
00:55:34,132 to 00:55:38,371
Oh, that's me?
Okay, let's see...
902
00:55:40,938 to 00:55:42,900
Sorry, minus two.
903
00:55:47,616 to 00:55:49,521
This game is fun.
904
00:55:49,590 to 00:55:51,536
All right,
how about this?
905
00:55:51,566 to 00:55:54,200
I'll see your bet
and I'll raise you.
906
00:55:55,663 to 00:55:57,799
2,000.
907
00:56:01,536 to 00:56:03,109
I'll see your 2,000
908
00:56:03,504 to 00:56:05,633
and I'll raise you
909
00:56:06,153 to 00:56:07,772
however much this is.
910
00:56:10,579 to 00:56:12,230
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Han.
911
00:56:12,292 to 00:56:13,821
Slow down.
912
00:56:13,948 to 00:56:15,530
You might wanna quit
while you're ahead.
913
00:56:15,604 to 00:56:17,605
You might wanna quit
while you're behind.
914
00:56:19,651 to 00:56:21,380
I like this kid.
915
00:56:21,452 to 00:56:22,547
You're adorable.
916
00:56:22,587 to 00:56:23,948
And I'm serious.
917
00:56:24,279 to 00:56:25,379
And I'm calling.
918
00:56:26,027 to 00:56:27,454
With what?
919
00:56:27,494 to 00:56:28,488
Your scarf?
920
00:56:28,647 to 00:56:29,724
Not my style.
921
00:56:29,764 to 00:56:30,931
My ship.
922
00:56:32,250 to 00:56:33,678
Against your ship.
923
00:56:35,626 to 00:56:37,461
Time to find out
if you got the nerve.
924
00:56:40,517 to 00:56:41,785
What the hell?
925
00:56:45,801 to 00:56:47,066
Straight Staves.
926
00:56:56,767 to 00:56:59,264
You played me.
You're good.
927
00:56:59,327 to 00:57:00,936
Yeah.
You're very good.
928
00:57:01,532 to 00:57:03,294
But not good enough.
929
00:57:03,529 to 00:57:04,480
Full Sabacc.
930
00:57:11,142 to 00:57:12,818
I told you to quit
while you were ahead.
931
00:57:14,906 to 00:57:16,909
Drinks on me!
932
00:57:21,114 to 00:57:22,514
Yeah, that's right.
933
00:57:29,694 to 00:57:31,015
First of all,
there's no way
934
00:57:31,017 to 00:57:32,596
he could've had
that green sylop.
935
00:57:32,598 to 00:57:33,602
They'd all been played.
936
00:57:33,604 to 00:57:35,332
Also, your guy,
Captain Wonderful,
937
00:57:35,337 to 00:57:36,778
is so full of bantha crap...
938
00:57:36,780 to 00:57:38,515
Yoohoo!
939
00:57:40,531 to 00:57:42,366
Where's my VCX?
940
00:57:42,776 to 00:57:44,391
I don't have it
right here now.
941
00:57:44,393 to 00:57:45,844
It's in the shop.
942
00:57:45,846 to 00:57:47,630
I'm getting some work done.
Lando.
943
00:57:49,460 to 00:57:50,889
Qi'ra.
944
00:57:52,009 to 00:57:55,105
You look phenomenal.
As always.
945
00:57:55,238 to 00:57:57,106
Well, I knew I was
gonna see you.
946
00:57:57,815 to 00:57:58,718
Get off!
947
00:57:58,720 to 00:58:00,146
What are you doing
with hairy and the boy?
948
00:58:00,148 to 00:58:02,612
There's no need, none.
They work for me.
949
00:58:02,710 to 00:58:03,877
Good help
is hard to find, no?
950
00:58:03,879 to 00:58:05,214
We're more like partners.
951
00:58:06,693 to 00:58:07,818
We are.
952
00:58:08,045 to 00:58:09,045
Excuse us.
953
00:58:09,959 to 00:58:11,293
Listen, last I checked,
954
00:58:11,295 to 00:58:12,992
me and Crimson Dawn,
we're squared away.
955
00:58:13,098 to 00:58:14,759
Dryden said
all is forgiven
956
00:58:14,761 to 00:58:16,968
after I did the whole
Felucia thing for him.
957
00:58:16,970 to 00:58:19,773
Yeah. New move,
we're making the Kessel Run.
958
00:58:21,493 to 00:58:22,754
We need a ship.
959
00:58:22,756 to 00:58:24,081
Why didn't you
just say so?
960
00:58:24,083 to 00:58:25,326
I thought
you were retired.
961
00:58:26,752 to 00:58:28,686
Circumstances change.
962
00:58:29,145 to 00:58:30,673
How much?
963
00:58:30,713 to 00:58:32,165
The Kessel Run.
964
00:58:32,233 to 00:58:35,003
That's no easy spin.
I'm gonna need half the take.
965
00:58:35,116 to 00:58:36,455
Ridiculous.
966
00:58:36,457 to 00:58:38,629
Grownups are talking.
967
00:58:38,860 to 00:58:40,095
25%.
968
00:58:45,361 to 00:58:46,628
You're Tobias Beckett.
969
00:58:47,418 to 00:58:48,892
You killed Aurra Sing.
970
00:58:50,008 to 00:58:52,520
Pushed her. Pretty sure
the fall killed her.
971
00:58:52,522 to 00:58:55,484
You did the galaxy a favor
that day. Me, especially.
972
00:58:55,486 to 00:58:56,514
I owed her
a lot of money.
973
00:58:56,516 to 00:58:58,611
And as token
of my gratitude,
974
00:58:58,978 to 00:59:01,262
I'm willing
to do this for 40%.
975
00:59:04,501 to 00:59:05,970
25.
976
00:59:11,122 to 00:59:13,084
25% works.
977
00:59:13,187 to 00:59:15,596
No! Unacceptable!
978
00:59:15,754 to 00:59:17,725
Stop exploiting droids!
979
00:59:17,795 to 00:59:19,946
You sloppy degenerate bios!
980
00:59:20,059 to 00:59:21,622
She never learns.
Have you no shame?
981
00:59:21,662 to 00:59:22,698
Who?
982
00:59:22,750 to 00:59:23,415
My first mate.
983
00:59:23,417 to 00:59:25,960
You got no business
being here. Get out of here!
984
00:59:26,000 to 00:59:28,878
How can you condone
this savagery?
985
00:59:28,976 to 00:59:31,671
You, you. You should
not be doing this.
986
00:59:31,673 to 00:59:34,311
They're using you
for entertainment.
987
00:59:34,313 to 00:59:36,176
Yeah. You've
been neurowashed.
988
00:59:36,207 to 00:59:38,401
Don't just blindly
follow the program.
989
00:59:38,403 to 00:59:40,422
Exercise some free will!
990
00:59:41,594 to 00:59:43,090
Stay away from him!
991
00:59:43,216 to 00:59:44,530
He's never
had it so good.
992
00:59:44,596 to 00:59:47,597
Oh, really? How about you have
a go at me, ya lumpy brute.
993
00:59:47,629 to 00:59:48,689
Bring it on!
Come on!
994
00:59:48,727 to 00:59:49,610
L3!
995
00:59:49,612 to 00:59:51,871
Droid rights!
We are sentient!
996
00:59:51,927 to 00:59:53,929
I'm gonna flip your switch.
997
00:59:54,870 to 00:59:56,049
Good luck finding it.
998
00:59:56,051 to 00:59:57,283
L3!
999
00:59:59,131 to 01:00:01,060
Let go
of the mean man's face.
1000
01:00:01,128 to 01:00:01,933
We're leaving.
1001
01:00:01,979 to 01:00:04,239
They don't even
serve our kind here.
1002
01:00:04,380 to 01:00:05,193
Now.
1003
01:00:09,005 to 01:00:10,667
Who are these guys?
1004
01:00:10,669 to 01:00:11,845
We're taking them
to Kessel.
1005
01:00:12,501 to 01:00:13,653
Oh, are we?
1006
01:00:14,326 to 01:00:16,591
And what if I don't elect
to go to Kessel?
1007
01:00:16,698 to 01:00:17,897
Please don't start.
1008
01:00:17,943 to 01:00:19,556
Or what,
you'll have me wiped?
1009
01:00:19,598 to 01:00:21,895
You couldn't get from here
to Black Spire without me.
1010
01:00:21,951 to 01:00:23,408
Now you're gonna
make the Kessel Run?
1011
01:00:23,462 to 01:00:25,524
If she doesn't wanna fly,
I'll be your copilot.
1012
01:00:25,564 to 01:00:27,292
I don't mind.
No, no. It's okay.
1013
01:00:27,638 to 01:00:28,864
She's definitely going.
1014
01:00:28,866 to 01:00:32,097
Oh, why? Because
you're my organic overlord?
1015
01:00:32,099 to 01:00:34,061
Because I'm your
captain, how about that?
1016
01:00:34,243 to 01:00:36,605
I actually would have
her memory wiped,
1017
01:00:36,607 to 01:00:37,424
but she's got
the best damn
1018
01:00:37,426 to 01:00:39,555
navigational database
in the galaxy.
1019
01:00:40,033 to 01:00:41,694
Could use a fresh coat
of paint, though!
1020
01:00:41,747 to 01:00:46,177
Landonis, you do not want to
press that button with me.
1021
01:00:46,369 to 01:00:48,932
You know, a lot of
ships around here get boosted.
1022
01:00:49,144 to 01:00:51,386
So, I keep mine locked up.
1023
01:00:51,421 to 01:00:53,102
You know, for safety.
1024
01:00:53,752 to 01:00:55,953
L3, do you mind?
1025
01:01:02,016 to 01:01:03,532
Look away.
1026
01:01:03,599 to 01:01:05,404
I can't perform
with you looking at me.
1027
01:01:05,590 to 01:01:06,542
Please indulge her.
1028
01:01:14,672 to 01:01:16,708
I can feel you
looking at me.
1029
01:01:21,842 to 01:01:23,446
What are we
doing here?
1030
01:01:23,448 to 01:01:24,682
This guy's a hustler.
1031
01:01:24,684 to 01:01:26,118
I don't even think
he's got a ship.
1032
01:01:26,120 to 01:01:27,748
If he does, it's gonna
be a piece of junk
1033
01:01:27,835 to 01:01:28,741
if it's even here.
1034
01:01:28,743 to 01:01:31,345
There she is,
my pride and joy.
1035
01:01:32,359 to 01:01:33,822
The Millennium Falcon.
1036
01:01:49,371 to 01:01:51,424
Looks like you had
a little work done.
1037
01:01:51,488 to 01:01:53,055
Indeed I have, Han.
1038
01:01:53,121 to 01:01:55,552
Installed an escape pod
in the mandible notch,
1039
01:01:55,615 to 01:01:58,225
alluvial dampers, a wet bar.
1040
01:01:58,353 to 01:01:59,880
And a fortified infraction
1041
01:01:59,882 to 01:02:02,145
restraint on the landing gear.
1042
01:02:02,560 to 01:02:05,296
Looks to me like they
impounded your ship, Lando.
1043
01:02:06,346 to 01:02:07,876
This is unbelievable!
1044
01:02:08,237 to 01:02:09,422
I'm definitely
gonna have some words
1045
01:02:09,424 to 01:02:11,548
with someone about this.
1046
01:02:13,284 to 01:02:15,453
You must have experience
with these, right?
1047
01:02:15,468 to 01:02:16,962
Yeah, I could
take it off.
1048
01:02:17,033 to 01:02:18,188
Fantastic!
1049
01:02:18,191 to 01:02:20,157
Along with five percent
off your cut.
1050
01:02:20,982 to 01:02:22,869
You're down to 20.
1051
01:02:25,503 to 01:02:27,364
I don't like it.
1052
01:02:27,366 to 01:02:28,801
I don't agree with it.
1053
01:02:29,928 to 01:02:31,129
But I accept it.
1054
01:02:32,624 to 01:02:34,274
You're getting
the hang of this, Lando.
1055
01:02:34,985 to 01:02:36,404
Yeah.
1056
01:02:36,406 to 01:02:37,605
Come on, Chewie.
1057
01:02:37,607 to 01:02:39,813
Gonna need a little bit of
that Wookiee oomph.
1058
01:02:41,892 to 01:02:43,744
Your plan
is underway, Enfys.
1059
01:02:43,804 to 01:02:45,386
We've attached
the homing beacon.
1060
01:02:45,388 to 01:02:47,362
They won't elude us now.
1061
01:02:47,437 to 01:02:48,438
Good.
1062
01:02:53,469 to 01:02:57,059
If they survive, they'll
bring the prize to us.
1063
01:03:13,384 to 01:03:15,573
This is a Corellian YT1300.
1064
01:03:16,222 to 01:03:18,124
Oh. You know your stuff.
1065
01:03:18,696 to 01:03:20,391
I've been on one before.
1066
01:03:20,447 to 01:03:21,451
My dad worked the line
1067
01:03:21,453 to 01:03:23,955
at the CEC plant
before he got laid off.
1068
01:03:25,141 to 01:03:26,309
He built these.
1069
01:03:27,563 to 01:03:29,860
He wanted
to be a pilot, but...
1070
01:03:30,235 to 01:03:32,237
You, uh,
close with your old man?
1071
01:03:33,200 to 01:03:34,362
Not really.
1072
01:03:34,503 to 01:03:36,533
Yeah, me neither.
1073
01:03:36,779 to 01:03:38,669
My mom,
on the other hand,
1074
01:03:38,927 to 01:03:40,878
most amazing woman
I've ever known.
1075
01:03:44,121 to 01:03:45,274
Excuse me.
1076
01:03:45,314 to 01:03:48,027
Get your presumptuous ass
out of my seat!
1077
01:03:53,722 to 01:03:56,685
My sacraloccipital
circuit is sticking.
1078
01:03:56,968 to 01:03:58,737
You're gonna have
to do that thing again later.
1079
01:03:59,049 to 01:04:00,657
Yeah.
1080
01:04:00,844 to 01:04:02,881
All right, course
to Kessel is set.
1081
01:04:02,943 to 01:04:04,559
Plugging coordinates
in now.
1082
01:04:04,704 to 01:04:06,124
Just keep your pinky
on the yoke
1083
01:04:06,179 to 01:04:07,362
and try not to mess
anything up.
1084
01:04:07,402 to 01:04:08,363
Whatever you say, my lady.
1085
01:04:08,403 to 01:04:09,999
Just let me know when
you're ready to jump.
1086
01:04:10,252 to 01:04:11,732
Ready in...
1087
01:04:14,645 to 01:04:15,645
Ready.
1088
01:04:16,384 to 01:04:18,900
It's just a simple jump to
hyperspace, and we're there.
1089
01:04:18,902 to 01:04:20,278
What's so tricky about that?
1090
01:04:20,317 to 01:04:22,690
Plenty. Can't plot
a direct course to Kessel.
1091
01:04:22,745 to 01:04:24,270
You have to thread through
the Si'Klaata Cluster
1092
01:04:24,327 to 01:04:26,790
and then pass through
The Maelstrom.
1093
01:04:27,072 to 01:04:28,740
You done flirting?
I'm still ready.
1094
01:04:30,093 to 01:04:31,794
You might wanna
buckle up, baby.
1095
01:04:52,562 to 01:04:53,641
Think.
1096
01:04:53,743 to 01:04:55,409
Do you wanna
make that move?
1097
01:04:55,552 to 01:04:57,850
Do you wanna
make that move?
1098
01:04:57,906 to 01:04:59,766
You made that move, okay.
1099
01:04:59,853 to 01:05:02,616
I guess I have to
destroy that little guy.
1100
01:05:02,656 to 01:05:04,798
Somehow I never
get bored with winning.
1101
01:05:06,245 to 01:05:08,852
No, you can't wipe 'em off.
They're holograms.
1102
01:05:09,876 to 01:05:11,930
Hey, hey, hey!
Chewie, relax!
1103
01:05:11,932 to 01:05:14,082
Hey, try to compose yourself.
1104
01:05:14,084 to 01:05:16,462
Look. All you gotta do is
think a few moves ahead,
1105
01:05:16,502 to 01:05:17,797
anticipate your opponent.
1106
01:05:17,837 to 01:05:20,231
There's a lesson
to be learned here.
1107
01:05:20,303 to 01:05:21,538
Uh, you guys seen Qi'ra?
1108
01:05:24,405 to 01:05:26,212
People are predictable.
1109
01:05:47,867 to 01:05:50,128
Yeah, I had to
try one on.
1110
01:05:50,262 to 01:05:51,696
That's a lot of capes.
1111
01:05:51,767 to 01:05:53,777
Maybe too many capes.
1112
01:05:58,176 to 01:05:59,804
So what's the plan?
1113
01:05:59,892 to 01:06:01,406
Well, I thought
we'd talk a little first
1114
01:06:01,408 to 01:06:03,265
and then you know...
1115
01:06:03,267 to 01:06:05,270
For Kessel.
Oh.
1116
01:06:05,363 to 01:06:06,878
Mmmhmm.
Good.
1117
01:06:06,956 to 01:06:08,513
Yeah? How good?
1118
01:06:08,895 to 01:06:09,681
Foolproof.
1119
01:06:09,721 to 01:06:11,481
Well, it better be.
1120
01:06:11,742 to 01:06:12,550
I...
I...
1121
01:06:12,649 to 01:06:13,817
You go first.
No.
1122
01:06:13,857 to 01:06:15,485
What were you gonna say?
1123
01:06:15,611 to 01:06:18,470
I wanna tell you
so much.
1124
01:06:18,955 to 01:06:20,523
And I wanna know
everything
1125
01:06:20,564 to 01:06:22,280
that's happened to you
since Corellia.
1126
01:06:23,700 to 01:06:26,274
I'm not sure
we have that kinda time.
1127
01:06:26,422 to 01:06:27,530
We could.
1128
01:06:27,570 to 01:06:29,952
We could have all the time
we want after the job.
1129
01:06:30,030 to 01:06:31,110
You and I.
1130
01:06:31,574 to 01:06:32,774
What?
1131
01:06:33,745 to 01:06:35,080
I want to.
1132
01:06:35,970 to 01:06:37,140
You want to?
1133
01:06:37,422 to 01:06:39,291
To tell you everything
that's happened.
1134
01:06:40,950 to 01:06:43,213
But I know if I do,
you won't look at me the same.
1135
01:06:43,520 to 01:06:45,242
The way that you're
looking at me right now.
1136
01:06:45,359 to 01:06:46,703
Nothing is gonna
change the way
1137
01:06:46,705 to 01:06:47,552
I'm looking at you
right now.
1138
01:06:47,554 to 01:06:50,039
You don't know that.
You don't know what I've done.
1139
01:07:03,850 to 01:07:05,412
Am I interrupting something?
1140
01:07:08,089 to 01:07:09,043
Kinda.
1141
01:07:09,734 to 01:07:10,578
Good.
1142
01:07:10,588 to 01:07:12,940
'Cause we got
a lot of work to do.
1143
01:07:12,980 to 01:07:14,526
You're making
a big mistake.
1144
01:07:14,596 to 01:07:15,656
Oh, really?
Which is yours to make
1145
01:07:15,658 to 01:07:17,879
except when you start to
interfere with my livelihood.
1146
01:07:17,919 to 01:07:18,946
This isn't gonna interfere
with your livelihood.
1147
01:07:18,986 to 01:07:19,947
Then we have a problem.
1148
01:07:19,987 to 01:07:22,445
You don't see it,
because you don't want to.
1149
01:07:22,447 to 01:07:24,085
Maybe I know her
a little better than you do.
1150
01:07:24,484 to 01:07:26,952
Maybe you don't know
her well enough.
1151
01:07:27,817 to 01:07:28,521
All right?
1152
01:07:28,686 to 01:07:30,090
Look.
1153
01:07:30,761 to 01:07:32,259
I like you, kid.
1154
01:07:32,375 to 01:07:34,846
We got a good thing going here.
Me, you, Chewie.
1155
01:07:34,910 to 01:07:35,797
Yeah.
Right?
1156
01:07:35,799 to 01:07:38,056
The makings
of a solid crew.
1157
01:07:38,170 to 01:07:40,231
But it does not work
with Qi'ra.
1158
01:07:40,451 to 01:07:42,684
It worked with Val.
You trusted her.
1159
01:07:44,633 to 01:07:47,388
You wanna know how I've
survived as long as I have?
1160
01:07:48,284 to 01:07:49,647
I trust no one.
1161
01:07:51,150 to 01:07:53,540
Assume everyone
will betray you
1162
01:07:53,542 to 01:07:55,421
and you will never
be disappointed.
1163
01:07:56,780 to 01:07:58,747
Sounds like
a lonely way to live.
1164
01:07:59,642 to 01:08:01,280
It's the only way.
1165
01:08:08,548 to 01:08:09,960
Dropping out
of lightspeed now.
1166
01:08:10,044 to 01:08:11,042
Ready to...
1167
01:08:16,485 to 01:08:18,452
The Akkadese Maelstrom.
1168
01:08:20,454 to 01:08:22,048
I'm gonna go check
on the dampers.
1169
01:08:22,088 to 01:08:23,017
You need anything?
1170
01:08:23,057 to 01:08:24,425
Equal rights?
1171
01:08:54,696 to 01:08:55,791
What's that sound?
1172
01:08:56,127 to 01:08:59,047
Carbonbergs, size of planets,
crashing into each other.
1173
01:08:59,049 to 01:09:01,576
Ships fly in there,
they never come out.
1174
01:09:01,632 to 01:09:03,625
It's ionized gas,
water vapor,
1175
01:09:03,704 to 01:09:05,405
possibly vacuumbreathing
life forms
1176
01:09:05,497 to 01:09:06,845
swirling around The Maw.
1177
01:09:06,918 to 01:09:08,831
Only way in or out
is this channel.
1178
01:09:10,536 to 01:09:12,770
So what are you gonna do
about your little problem?
1179
01:09:13,171 to 01:09:14,305
Problem?
1180
01:09:14,499 to 01:09:15,870
Uh...
1181
01:09:16,353 to 01:09:17,276
Well, that brand
on your wrist
1182
01:09:17,323 to 01:09:19,371
tells me that
you're committed.
1183
01:09:19,411 to 01:09:21,305
And that young male's
heart fluctuations
1184
01:09:21,345 to 01:09:22,712
tell me
he's in love with you.
1185
01:09:22,782 to 01:09:25,376
Han is not
in love with me!
1186
01:09:26,521 to 01:09:28,589
Oh, please. It's just us.
1187
01:09:28,633 to 01:09:32,198
You don't have to pretend.
I'm in the same situation.
1188
01:09:32,308 to 01:09:33,071
You are?
1189
01:09:33,073 to 01:09:34,085
I'm sure you've noticed
1190
01:09:34,087 to 01:09:35,558
that Lando
has feelings for me.
1191
01:09:35,560 to 01:09:37,095
Which makes
working together difficult
1192
01:09:37,097 to 01:09:39,544
because I do not feel
the same way about him.
1193
01:09:39,546 to 01:09:40,940
Right.
1194
01:09:41,031 to 01:09:42,708
Yes, yeah.
1195
01:09:42,741 to 01:09:44,248
Yeah, I see that.
1196
01:09:44,334 to 01:09:47,070
Sometimes, I think...
Maybe.
1197
01:09:47,799 to 01:09:49,135
But, no.
1198
01:09:51,077 to 01:09:52,644
We're just not compatible.
1199
01:09:54,733 to 01:09:56,301
How would that work?
1200
01:09:57,136 to 01:09:58,135
It works.
1201
01:10:08,282 to 01:10:10,311
This is a precision job.
1202
01:10:10,313 to 01:10:12,931
Thermal vault will be
on the lowest level.
1203
01:10:13,015 to 01:10:14,343
Down where it's warm.
1204
01:10:14,345 to 01:10:16,865
The only way
we're gonna pull this off
1205
01:10:16,867 to 01:10:19,071
is if everybody
plays their part.
1206
01:10:19,073 to 01:10:20,924
Stick to the plan.
1207
01:10:20,926 to 01:10:23,062
Do not improvise.
1208
01:10:27,828 to 01:10:30,001
Mining colonies
are the worst.
1209
01:10:30,003 to 01:10:31,620
Yeah, well, "the worst"
1210
01:10:31,622 to 01:10:33,266
is where the money is.
1211
01:10:35,430 to 01:10:37,641
All right, people.
Time to shine.
1212
01:11:14,115 to 01:11:15,996
It won't be for long.
1213
01:11:15,998 to 01:11:17,926
Shut up, the both of you.
1214
01:11:17,928 to 01:11:19,688
I am Oksana Floren,
1215
01:11:19,690 to 01:11:22,147
Deputy Assistant Administrator
to the ViceAdmiral
1216
01:11:22,149 to 01:11:25,000
of the Federation of
Trade Route Allocation
1217
01:11:25,035 to 01:11:26,513
and Monetization.
1218
01:11:26,629 to 01:11:29,008
Here with an offer
from his eminence,
1219
01:11:29,010 to 01:11:31,061
the Senior ViceAdmiral.
1220
01:11:31,837 to 01:11:34,699
Your spice for our
hardworking slaves.
1221
01:11:34,778 to 01:11:36,261
I brought you a sample.
1222
01:11:36,354 to 01:11:39,023
Tuul, bring forth
the merchandise.
1223
01:12:07,844 to 01:12:09,572
Director Tolsite
said our slaves
1224
01:12:09,574 to 01:12:10,765
should follow those guys
1225
01:12:10,767 to 01:12:12,623
to get clipped
and tagged.
1226
01:12:12,677 to 01:12:14,809
What are they
clipping?
1227
01:12:14,868 to 01:12:16,971
Mmmhmm.
1228
01:12:18,566 to 01:12:20,020
He wants us
to follow him.
1229
01:12:24,088 to 01:12:24,815
Really?
1230
01:12:24,817 to 01:12:26,113
That's for that stunt
you pulled earlier,
1231
01:12:26,115 to 01:12:27,505
you degenerate scum.
1232
01:12:47,032 to 01:12:48,702
He says all systems
in this sector
1233
01:12:48,704 to 01:12:50,836
of the facility operate
out of this room.
1234
01:12:50,838 to 01:12:52,532
It's how they're able
to maintain control
1235
01:12:52,534 to 01:12:54,492
over so many
with so few.
1236
01:12:58,598 to 01:13:00,640
The director says
their reconditioning process
1237
01:13:00,642 to 01:13:03,031
is excruciating
but effective.
1238
01:13:18,204 to 01:13:20,544
He said your security attache
can wait there.
1239
01:13:20,636 to 01:13:22,905
"Surely, we don't need him
to negotiate."
1240
01:13:25,600 to 01:13:27,109
Wait there, Tuul.
1241
01:13:27,173 to 01:13:28,909
Try not to bother anyone.
1242
01:13:53,774 to 01:13:54,876
Nice!
1243
01:13:55,545 to 01:13:56,339
That was the uniform
1244
01:13:56,341 to 01:13:58,922
that would've fit me
perfectly, but it's fine.
1245
01:14:08,367 to 01:14:10,168
Would you mind
holding this for me?
1246
01:14:24,597 to 01:14:25,891
Whoa.
1247
01:14:25,893 to 01:14:27,803
I have never see anyone do...
1248
01:14:27,841 to 01:14:28,800
What was that?
1249
01:14:28,802 to 01:14:31,000
Teras Kasi.
1250
01:14:32,546 to 01:14:34,193
Dryden taught me.
1251
01:14:38,726 to 01:14:39,830
Ah.
1252
01:14:39,832 to 01:14:41,098
Well negotiated.
1253
01:14:51,250 to 01:14:53,419
Excuse me.
I need to use this terminal.
1254
01:14:53,510 to 01:14:54,511
Hello?
1255
01:14:55,760 to 01:14:58,283
Can you hear me? Ugh.
1256
01:14:58,669 to 01:15:00,346
Restraining bolts...
1257
01:15:00,429 to 01:15:01,638
Barbaric.
1258
01:15:03,603 to 01:15:05,519
Congratulations!
You're liberated. Scoot.
1259
01:15:05,523 to 01:15:06,551
I don't know.
1260
01:15:06,553 to 01:15:07,987
Free your brothers and sisters
or something.
1261
01:15:08,024 to 01:15:09,594
Just give me some space.
1262
01:15:15,619 to 01:15:16,897
I'm in!
1263
01:15:16,899 to 01:15:17,964
Han, can you hear me?
1264
01:15:17,966 to 01:15:19,625
I kinda need to
know which way to go here.
1265
01:15:19,994 to 01:15:20,852
L3?
1266
01:15:20,892 to 01:15:22,573
The thermal vault
is down two levels,
1267
01:15:22,575 to 01:15:24,589
then left, then right,
then it's the third left.
1268
01:15:24,629 to 01:15:27,632
Right. That's a lot of
directions, but we're on it.
1269
01:15:34,587 to 01:15:35,765
They're in subsector four,
1270
01:15:35,767 to 01:15:38,216
coming up on gate X371K.
1271
01:15:38,218 to 01:15:39,452
Overriding!
1272
01:15:45,772 to 01:15:46,706
Freedom.
1273
01:16:09,371 to 01:16:11,433
What the hell
are you guys doing up there?
1274
01:16:11,607 to 01:16:13,509
I created a distraction!
1275
01:16:18,369 to 01:16:19,621
Come on! This way!
1276
01:16:22,126 to 01:16:23,998
Wait! What are you doing?
1277
01:16:24,000 to 01:16:25,858
Come on,
we gotta get the coaxium.
1278
01:16:28,162 to 01:16:30,518
Hey! Remember what Beckett
said, stick to the plan.
1279
01:16:30,520 to 01:16:33,457
Chewie! Come on, let's go!
1280
01:16:37,051 to 01:16:37,829
Fine!
1281
01:16:40,338 to 01:16:41,406
Chewie!
1282
01:16:44,068 to 01:16:45,565
Here, you might need this.
1283
01:16:50,669 to 01:16:52,669
Hope I see you around
sometime.
1284
01:17:08,397 to 01:17:09,692
Han, where are you?
1285
01:17:09,935 to 01:17:11,528
I'm on my way
to the vault.
1286
01:17:11,631 to 01:17:12,803
I lost Chewie.
1287
01:17:12,863 to 01:17:13,878
He's dead?
1288
01:17:13,880 to 01:17:15,734
No, he had something
he had to do.
1289
01:17:15,736 to 01:17:16,996
Is he coming back?
1290
01:17:17,036 to 01:17:18,044
I don't know.
1291
01:17:19,330 to 01:17:21,332
Okay, they're on to us now.
1292
01:17:31,161 to 01:17:32,228
I'm at the vault.
1293
01:17:40,051 to 01:17:41,545
That's what I said!
1294
01:17:44,860 to 01:17:46,895
Huh, that was impressive.
Yeah.
1295
01:17:47,218 to 01:17:48,203
We're clear.
1296
01:17:58,775 to 01:17:59,904
Now what?
1297
01:18:00,116 to 01:18:01,846
Han, each canister
should be equipped
1298
01:18:01,908 to 01:18:03,106
with a thermal display.
1299
01:18:03,108 to 01:18:04,288
Yeah, I see it.
1300
01:18:04,290 to 01:18:07,418
If the internal temperature
reaches below 35 standard,
1301
01:18:07,420 to 01:18:10,550
then the coaxium will
destabilize and explode.
1302
01:18:10,552 to 01:18:13,039
Yup, I get it, guys.
It's dangerous.
1303
01:18:21,884 to 01:18:23,478
Okay, got it.
1304
01:18:23,557 to 01:18:25,291
Great. Only eleven more.
1305
01:18:25,735 to 01:18:26,736
Eleven?
1306
01:18:34,264 to 01:18:37,194
The Calrissian Chronicles,
chapter five.
1307
01:18:37,390 to 01:18:38,909
continued.
1308
01:18:38,911 to 01:18:40,970
Personally, I wasn't all that
impressed with the Sharu.
1309
01:18:40,972 to 01:18:43,361
No sense of humor or style.
1310
01:18:43,363 to 01:18:45,511
Nonetheless,
there L3 and I were
1311
01:18:45,513 to 01:18:47,376
deep in their sacred temple.
1312
01:18:47,434 to 01:18:49,228
And that's when we saw it...
1313
01:18:51,777 to 01:18:53,312
Always something.
1314
01:18:55,686 to 01:18:57,548
You guys are not gonna believe
what I'm seeing up here.
1315
01:18:57,675 to 01:18:59,684
Is it
a mass breakout?
1316
01:19:00,161 to 01:19:01,137
L3, what did you do?
1317
01:19:01,139 to 01:19:03,233
I found my true purpose,
Lando.
1318
01:19:03,235 to 01:19:04,551
That's what I've done.
1319
01:19:06,203 to 01:19:08,496
I'm so glad
we took this job!
1320
01:19:08,498 to 01:19:09,968
That droid!
1321
01:19:09,970 to 01:19:11,129
L3, come on!
1322
01:19:14,362 to 01:19:16,011
Follow me, compatriots!
1323
01:19:23,281 to 01:19:25,160
Another couple guards
just spotted me.
1324
01:19:25,162 to 01:19:27,112
I don't have a free hand
to take 'em out.
1325
01:19:27,114 to 01:19:28,834
What do I do?
Improvise.
1326
01:19:28,890 to 01:19:30,791
You said never improvise!
1327
01:19:39,452 to 01:19:40,834
Hi!
1328
01:19:40,889 to 01:19:41,997
Don't forget that guy!
1329
01:19:58,229 to 01:20:00,182
Good to see you, buddy!
1330
01:20:00,371 to 01:20:02,454
Stay with me, Sagwa!
Keep up!
1331
01:20:05,826 to 01:20:07,569
Hey! I'm Chewie's
friend, Han.
1332
01:20:10,303 to 01:20:11,273
Okay.
1333
01:20:38,598 to 01:20:40,732
Han!
1334
01:20:42,457 to 01:20:43,458
Hey!
1335
01:20:54,734 to 01:20:55,822
Follow me.
1336
01:20:58,185 to 01:21:00,618
Rebellion!
1337
01:21:10,743 to 01:21:12,258
They're going for
the landing gear!
1338
01:21:12,260 to 01:21:13,603
We've gotta
get out of here!
1339
01:21:15,463 to 01:21:17,953
We need to keep 'em away
from those cannons!
1340
01:21:26,055 to 01:21:27,256
Catch that!
1341
01:21:29,753 to 01:21:31,598
Coaxium's stowed!
Let's go!
1342
01:21:32,038 to 01:21:33,412
Where's L3?
1343
01:21:33,456 to 01:21:36,527
No more subjugation!
1344
01:21:40,657 to 01:21:41,964
L3!
1345
01:21:41,973 to 01:21:43,975
No, Lando!
Get back here!
1346
01:21:46,631 to 01:21:47,933
Lando!
1347
01:21:48,987 to 01:21:50,664
System failure.
1348
01:21:50,666 to 01:21:52,902
Have to reroute
the sensory modulators.
1349
01:21:52,966 to 01:21:54,584
It's all right.
Save your energy.
1350
01:21:54,586 to 01:21:56,349
I'm gonna get you outta here.
All right?
1351
01:21:56,351 to 01:21:57,985
System failure...
1352
01:22:03,540 to 01:22:04,690
Rerouting...
1353
01:22:06,079 to 01:22:07,372
Damn it!
1354
01:22:07,374 to 01:22:08,205
Han!
1355
01:22:13,894 to 01:22:15,227
Sagwa.
1356
01:22:15,288 to 01:22:16,724
This way!
1357
01:22:17,478 to 01:22:18,882
Come, come!
1358
01:22:29,118 to 01:22:30,785
Chewie!
Damn it!
1359
01:22:34,602 to 01:22:35,970
It's not responding.
1360
01:22:53,236 to 01:22:55,340
What are you
standing around for? Come on!
1361
01:23:01,107 to 01:23:02,666
It's okay,
you'll be fine.
1362
01:23:04,380 to 01:23:06,281
It's not responding...
Not responding...
1363
01:23:06,874 to 01:23:08,108
Han, get us out of here.
1364
01:23:09,202 to 01:23:09,965
It's not responding.
1365
01:23:09,967 to 01:23:11,328
Han! Now!
1366
01:23:12,011 to 01:23:13,011
On it.
1367
01:23:41,206 to 01:23:42,426
Lando...
I'm here.
1368
01:23:42,943 to 01:23:44,703
It's all right, L3.
Lando...
1369
01:23:44,705 to 01:23:45,856
I've got you.
This is not...
1370
01:23:45,858 to 01:23:47,416
It's okay, L3.
Lando.
1371
01:23:47,418 to 01:23:49,851
It's all right. I can fix you.
I can fix you.
1372
01:23:50,055 to 01:23:51,255
Lando.
1373
01:23:51,257 to 01:23:53,307
What's happening to me?
1374
01:23:56,009 to 01:23:57,243
L3?
1375
01:23:57,943 to 01:23:59,011
L3!
1376
01:24:06,129 to 01:24:08,383
I'm sorry, girl.
1377
01:24:08,385 to 01:24:09,987
I'm so sorry.
1378
01:24:23,865 to 01:24:25,168
I could use a copilot.
1379
01:24:49,552 to 01:24:50,987
Sorry.
1380
01:24:53,833 to 01:24:54,788
With the cargo
we're carrying,
1381
01:24:54,790 to 01:24:56,015
if we don't make up
some lost time
1382
01:24:56,017 to 01:24:58,379
we're gonna be
in real trouble.
1383
01:24:58,501 to 01:25:00,026
How about that?
Is that real trouble?
1384
01:25:06,612 to 01:25:08,985
That is an Imperial blockade.
1385
01:25:08,987 to 01:25:10,663
What's it doing here?
1386
01:25:10,665 to 01:25:12,654
Probably heard about
your little rebellion.
1387
01:25:14,366 to 01:25:16,196
Nope.
Not gonna make it.
1388
01:25:16,198 to 01:25:17,429
We're gonna have to
drop the shipment.
1389
01:25:17,431 to 01:25:19,944
If we don't deliver,
Dryden will kill us.
1390
01:25:19,946 to 01:25:21,641
All right, trust me,
I know these guys.
1391
01:25:21,643 to 01:25:22,906
I used to be one of 'em.
1392
01:25:22,908 to 01:25:24,836
There's no way they're
gonna waste a TIE fighter
1393
01:25:24,838 to 01:25:26,767
chasing down a little
rinkydink freighter.
1394
01:25:31,622 to 01:25:32,344
You were saying?
1395
01:25:32,346 to 01:25:33,886
Usually,
in situations like this
1396
01:25:33,888 to 01:25:36,014
I like to turn around
in the opposite direction.
1397
01:25:45,173 to 01:25:46,675
I'm on the ventral gun.
1398
01:25:52,043 to 01:25:53,252
It's an easy equation.
1399
01:25:53,254 to 01:25:55,284
We simply don't have enough
time to get to Savareen
1400
01:25:55,286 to 01:25:56,506
before the canisters explode!
1401
01:25:56,508 to 01:25:57,882
Just have to find
a faster route.
1402
01:25:57,884 to 01:25:58,984
There isn't one!
You can't make
1403
01:25:58,986 to 01:26:00,770
the Kessel Run
in less than 20 parsecs.
1404
01:26:00,772 to 01:26:02,253
Watch me.
How?
1405
01:26:02,309 to 01:26:04,192
Take a shortcut,
through there.
1406
01:26:05,120 to 01:26:07,188
Into The Maelstrom?
Mmmhmm.
1407
01:26:07,190 to 01:26:09,244
Spectacular way of killing
us all, I'll give you that.
1408
01:26:09,246 to 01:26:11,134
Can't do it without L3.
She's gone!
1409
01:26:11,136 to 01:26:12,524
You said yourself
she's got the best
1410
01:26:12,526 to 01:26:14,116
navigational database
in the galaxy.
1411
01:26:14,118 to 01:26:15,295
If we remove
her neural core,
1412
01:26:15,297 to 01:26:16,670
it's possible we can
download her brain
1413
01:26:16,672 to 01:26:18,819
into the Falcon's
navicomputer, right?
1414
01:26:18,898 to 01:26:19,899
Could we?
1415
01:26:20,223 to 01:26:21,454
Theoretically.
1416
01:26:21,456 to 01:26:23,124
Only one way to find out.
1417
01:26:26,000 to 01:26:27,967
I got a really good feeling
about this.
1418
01:26:42,381 to 01:26:43,847
Oops, that's on me.
1419
01:26:50,934 to 01:26:52,268
Okay.
1420
01:26:54,377 to 01:26:56,220
Beckett, you see them?
They still on us?
1421
01:26:59,425 to 01:27:00,795
Beckett, did you hear me?
1422
01:27:00,797 to 01:27:02,059
Are they on us?
1423
01:27:02,061 to 01:27:04,143
Like rashnold on a kalak.
1424
01:27:05,024 to 01:27:06,522
I don't know
what that means.
1425
01:27:06,553 to 01:27:08,782
Like a gingleson's pelt.
1426
01:27:09,034 to 01:27:10,755
What?
Are they or aren't they?
1427
01:27:10,757 to 01:27:12,570
Yes, they're still on us!
1428
01:27:14,711 to 01:27:15,911
Whoo!
1429
01:27:19,271 to 01:27:24,086
This is why you never let
anyone fly your ship.
1430
01:27:24,124 to 01:27:25,161
Come on!
1431
01:27:29,434 to 01:27:32,114
Yeah, one just got past me.
He's right on top of us!
1432
01:27:41,746 to 01:27:43,115
Good going, Han!
1433
01:27:49,117 to 01:27:50,396
We need to
divert auxiliary power
1434
01:27:50,398 to 01:27:51,649
to the rear deflector shield.
1435
01:27:51,651 to 01:27:54,549
We definitely do!
1436
01:28:01,203 to 01:28:02,976
Since when do you know
how to fly?
1437
01:28:05,449 to 01:28:07,112
190 years old?
1438
01:28:08,987 to 01:28:10,215
You look great!
1439
01:28:11,423 to 01:28:12,685
Chewie, get in.
1440
01:28:12,740 to 01:28:13,821
I'll help Lando.
1441
01:28:28,833 to 01:28:31,094
Whoa!
That's my cape!
1442
01:28:31,096 to 01:28:32,873
Ah! That's a custom piece!
1443
01:28:40,391 to 01:28:42,322
What? Beckett, you with us?
1444
01:28:42,324 to 01:28:44,678
We just lost the cannon!
1445
01:28:44,680 to 01:28:46,641
And I really hurt
my thumbs.
1446
01:28:46,728 to 01:28:48,163
There's still one on us.
1447
01:28:54,172 to 01:28:55,608
Drop the landing gear.
1448
01:28:56,139 to 01:28:57,610
When I tell you,
flood the intake
1449
01:28:57,612 to 01:28:59,145
and sweep to the bilats.
1450
01:29:02,839 to 01:29:05,488
A little something I picked up
from my pal, Needles,
1451
01:29:05,490 to 01:29:07,439
best street racer
in all of Corellia.
1452
01:29:08,509 to 01:29:09,837
Till he crashed
1453
01:29:09,964 to 01:29:12,295
and died, doing this.
1454
01:29:30,123 to 01:29:31,756
Flood it, it's all yours!
1455
01:29:43,523 to 01:29:45,853
Nice move!
1456
01:29:48,865 to 01:29:50,565
Pull out her
internal processor.
1457
01:29:53,575 to 01:29:54,477
Sorry.
1458
01:30:01,061 to 01:30:02,186
We've got L3.
1459
01:30:04,193 to 01:30:05,707
Remove the mod calibrator.
1460
01:30:05,709 to 01:30:06,770
Make sure
the TLine's connected.
1461
01:30:06,826 to 01:30:08,458
I'm gonna tuck it in.
Don't worry.
1462
01:30:08,529 to 01:30:09,493
You close?
1463
01:30:09,495 to 01:30:11,958
That coaxium's
getting real ripe.
1464
01:30:12,201 to 01:30:14,329
Okay.
1465
01:30:16,226 to 01:30:17,929
She's interfacing.
1466
01:30:22,031 to 01:30:23,933
She's part of the ship now.
1467
01:30:35,514 to 01:30:36,986
Where the hell are we?
1468
01:30:37,030 to 01:30:38,397
We're way off
the edge of the map.
1469
01:30:39,162 to 01:30:40,116
Wait.
1470
01:30:40,172 to 01:30:42,808
L3's constructing a model
of The Maelstrom.
1471
01:30:45,306 to 01:30:47,707
She says we're
approaching The Maw.
1472
01:30:47,748 to 01:30:48,877
That doesn't
sound like something
1473
01:30:48,879 to 01:30:50,385
we wanna be approaching.
1474
01:31:11,445 to 01:31:12,388
Hang on!
1475
01:31:18,048 to 01:31:18,837
This is The Maw?
1476
01:31:18,839 to 01:31:20,882
No, that's not The Maw.
I don't know what this is.
1477
01:31:20,884 to 01:31:22,119
That's a living thing.
1478
01:31:36,840 to 01:31:38,135
There!
1479
01:31:38,213 to 01:31:39,313
That's The Maw.
1480
01:31:42,312 to 01:31:43,696
It's a gravity well.
1481
01:31:43,916 to 01:31:44,994
I got an idea.
1482
01:31:46,143 to 01:31:47,924
Don't fly toward it, Han!
1483
01:31:55,581 to 01:31:56,853
See if it goes for this.
1484
01:31:56,855 to 01:31:58,690
No, what are you doing?
That's the escape pod!
1485
01:32:00,158 to 01:32:01,326
I know.
1486
01:32:04,364 to 01:32:05,634
Then why'd you do it?
1487
01:32:13,051 to 01:32:14,419
That's why, baby.
1488
01:32:23,339 to 01:32:24,505
She found a way out.
1489
01:32:25,253 to 01:32:27,865
90 degrees,
to the left... ish.
1490
01:32:27,937 to 01:32:28,865
Leftish.
1491
01:32:28,952 to 01:32:30,231
I can't.
1492
01:32:30,270 to 01:32:32,141
It's taking everything we got
to stay out of The Maw.
1493
01:32:32,172 to 01:32:33,807
It's pulling us in.
We're stuck.
1494
01:32:37,769 to 01:32:40,226
We have enough raw coaxium
to power a dozen destroyers.
1495
01:32:40,282 to 01:32:42,219
Inject it into the fuel line,
it'll blow up the ship.
1496
01:32:42,221 to 01:32:43,652
Not the fuel line.
1497
01:32:43,654 to 01:32:45,895
But if we put one drop
into the fusion reactor,
1498
01:32:45,950 to 01:32:46,457
it might just...
1499
01:32:46,516 to 01:32:47,922
Give us the kick we need.
1500
01:32:47,963 to 01:32:49,729
All right, I'm on it!
1501
01:32:54,150 to 01:32:55,911
I know, we're getting
dragged in a circle.
1502
01:33:09,979 to 01:33:12,217
Once we get lined up,
it's gonna be a straight shot.
1503
01:33:12,296 to 01:33:13,337
As soon as that
coaxium ignites,
1504
01:33:13,363 to 01:33:14,167
we're gonna
tear out of here
1505
01:33:14,169 to 01:33:15,743
and the second we're
clear of The Maelstrom,
1506
01:33:15,745 to 01:33:17,135
we jump to lightspeed.
1507
01:33:21,122 to 01:33:22,270
Beckett!
1508
01:33:22,272 to 01:33:23,674
Can't talk!
1509
01:33:27,621 to 01:33:28,655
I see it.
1510
01:33:53,193 to 01:33:54,133
Beckett, hurry up!
1511
01:33:54,135 to 01:33:56,198
We only get one shot
at this thing!
1512
01:33:56,529 to 01:33:58,463
Shut up
and let me do this!
1513
01:34:06,706 to 01:34:09,307
Beckett, I'm gonna
count you down!
1514
01:34:10,323 to 01:34:11,657
Three!
1515
01:34:14,577 to 01:34:15,611
Two!
1516
01:34:19,698 to 01:34:20,836
Now!
1517
01:34:20,905 to 01:34:21,933
Now?
1518
01:34:22,013 to 01:34:22,782
Now!
1519
01:34:39,014 to 01:34:40,783
Oh, shoot...
1520
01:34:53,530 to 01:34:54,980
Chewie, when I tell you,
kick out the thrusters
1521
01:34:54,982 to 01:34:56,716
and jump to lightspeed.
Wait, what are we...
1522
01:34:56,718 to 01:34:57,919
Remember that alley
we slipped through
1523
01:34:57,921 to 01:34:59,080
in the Santhe Shipyards?
1524
01:34:59,082 to 01:35:01,130
Yeah, I remember!
I remember it didn't work.
1525
01:35:01,132 to 01:35:02,433
This time it's gonna.
1526
01:35:12,644 to 01:35:13,645
Punch it!
1527
01:35:24,655 to 01:35:26,758
Savareen,
this is Millennium Falcon.
1528
01:35:26,760 to 01:35:29,662
We have coaxium that needs to
be offloaded immediately.
1529
01:35:29,664 to 01:35:32,100
Like immediately,
immediately!
1530
01:35:33,009 to 01:35:34,337
We're here now...
1531
01:35:34,596 to 01:35:35,697
...see you. I...
1532
01:36:06,676 to 01:36:08,889
Just did the Kessel Run
in 12 parsecs.
1533
01:36:13,131 to 01:36:15,071
Not if you round down, buddy.
1534
01:36:15,425 to 01:36:16,425
Yeah.
1535
01:36:22,488 to 01:36:24,757
She is a hell of a ship.
1536
01:36:33,356 to 01:36:34,817
I hate you.
1537
01:36:34,881 to 01:36:36,348
I know.
1538
01:36:38,728 to 01:36:40,725
I'm gonna be on my ship,
1539
01:36:40,890 to 01:36:42,683
in my quarters,
1540
01:36:42,685 to 01:36:45,756
waiting for you
to bring me my share.
1541
01:36:47,965 to 01:36:50,401
And then I don't ever
wanna see you again.
1542
01:36:55,016 to 01:36:56,417
Never?
1543
01:37:10,179 to 01:37:12,107
Where's your boss?
1544
01:37:12,288 to 01:37:14,615
Oh. Don't worry.
He'll be here.
1545
01:37:15,858 to 01:37:16,693
Then what?
1546
01:37:17,293 to 01:37:20,090
Well, you delivered,
1547
01:37:20,388 to 01:37:22,384
so you will get paid.
1548
01:37:22,658 to 01:37:25,049
You can buy that ship.
1549
01:37:25,111 to 01:37:28,281
You know that's not
what I'm asking.
1550
01:37:30,950 to 01:37:32,585
It can't happen.
1551
01:37:36,846 to 01:37:38,230
Because you're with Dryden?
1552
01:37:38,232 to 01:37:41,344
I'm not with him,
but I owe him.
1553
01:37:43,073 to 01:37:45,109
He helped me out
of a bad situation.
1554
01:37:46,325 to 01:37:48,355
And how long do you have
to pay off that debt?
1555
01:37:51,831 to 01:37:54,433
Everyone serves
somebody, Han.
1556
01:37:55,287 to 01:37:57,609
Even Dryden Vos.
1557
01:37:57,655 to 01:38:00,430
Look, you don't want to make
an enemy of Crimson Dawn
1558
01:38:00,432 to 01:38:02,882
which is exactly what you
and I would both be doing
1559
01:38:02,884 to 01:38:04,374
if I left here with you.
1560
01:38:04,376 to 01:38:06,217
I'm not afraid
of Crimson Dawn.
1561
01:38:06,219 to 01:38:08,348
I can take care of myself.
1562
01:38:08,587 to 01:38:09,959
You know,
I'm not the kid you knew
1563
01:38:09,961 to 01:38:11,530
on Corellia anymore, Qi'ra.
1564
01:38:11,576 to 01:38:12,663
No?
No.
1565
01:38:12,665 to 01:38:13,732
Then who are you?
1566
01:38:14,717 to 01:38:16,064
I'm an outlaw.
1567
01:38:17,967 to 01:38:19,246
What? I'm not kidding.
1568
01:38:19,339 to 01:38:20,555
Okay.
1569
01:38:20,557 to 01:38:23,448
Okay, outlaw,
you can tell yourself that,
1570
01:38:23,597 to 01:38:25,803
but I might be the only person
in the whole galaxy
1571
01:38:25,805 to 01:38:27,350
who knows
what you really are.
1572
01:38:27,352 to 01:38:29,247
Yeah.
1573
01:38:29,249 to 01:38:30,584
What's that?
1574
01:38:32,991 to 01:38:34,494
You are the good guy.
1575
01:38:36,681 to 01:38:39,443
I am not the good guy.
1576
01:38:39,445 to 01:38:43,109
I am definitely
not a good guy.
1577
01:38:43,351 to 01:38:44,782
I'm a terrible person.
1578
01:38:45,329 to 01:38:46,705
Hey!
1579
01:38:46,707 to 01:38:48,293
They say when
the coaxium's refined,
1580
01:38:48,295 to 01:38:49,842
we collect it up there.
1581
01:39:14,375 to 01:39:16,468
So, I hear
you make good brandy.
1582
01:39:19,885 to 01:39:21,320
Beckett.
1583
01:39:46,043 to 01:39:47,111
Don't.
1584
01:39:48,489 to 01:39:51,049
You must've known
you'd see me again.
1585
01:39:51,051 to 01:39:52,579
I was counting on it.
1586
01:39:52,581 to 01:39:54,895
Just didn't plan on it
being so soon.
1587
01:39:56,045 to 01:39:57,878
Of course now,
you've got a problem.
1588
01:39:57,922 to 01:39:59,824
Big problem.
1589
01:40:03,555 to 01:40:06,051
You happen to notice
that freighter down there?
1590
01:40:06,192 to 01:40:08,259
You know what's on it?
1591
01:40:08,307 to 01:40:10,153
About 30 hired guns.
1592
01:40:10,155 to 01:40:12,367
All I gotta do
is give 'em the signal,
1593
01:40:12,369 to 01:40:13,604
you're surrounded.
1594
01:40:29,653 to 01:40:31,655
Sorry.
You do your thing.
1595
01:40:32,986 to 01:40:35,330
By the time that coaxium
gets refined,
1596
01:40:35,332 to 01:40:37,131
Crimson Dawn will be here,
1597
01:40:37,133 to 01:40:39,136
so you go ahead
and kill us.
1598
01:40:39,138 to 01:40:41,033
They're gonna kill you.
1599
01:40:41,035 to 01:40:42,464
Perhaps
there's a compromise,
1600
01:40:42,466 to 01:40:44,256
one that doesn't involve
so much killing.
1601
01:40:44,455 to 01:40:46,619
They're marauders.
1602
01:40:46,621 to 01:40:48,757
They don't care
about anybody.
1603
01:40:49,665 to 01:40:51,566
All they know
how to do is kill.
1604
01:41:15,069 to 01:41:16,503
I need a drink.
1605
01:41:16,991 to 01:41:18,527
Bring them inside.
1606
01:41:30,589 to 01:41:32,524
My mother once told me
1607
01:41:32,526 to 01:41:33,884
about a band of mercenaries
1608
01:41:33,886 to 01:41:36,215
that came
to a peaceful planet.
1609
01:41:36,408 to 01:41:39,637
They had a resource there
these men coveted,
1610
01:41:39,911 to 01:41:41,774
so they took it.
1611
01:41:41,860 to 01:41:45,173
They kept coming back,
taking more.
1612
01:41:45,175 to 01:41:47,803
Until finally,
the people resisted.
1613
01:41:48,084 to 01:41:49,844
When they returned
demanding their tribute,
1614
01:41:49,846 to 01:41:53,509
the people shouted back
in one voice, "No more!"
1615
01:41:53,797 to 01:41:56,061
The mercenaries didn't like
the sound of that,
1616
01:41:56,195 to 01:41:57,092
so they cut off the tongue
1617
01:41:57,094 to 01:42:00,825
of every last man,
woman, and child.
1618
01:42:01,235 to 01:42:03,003
Do you know what
that pack of animals became?
1619
01:42:04,688 to 01:42:05,688
Tell them.
1620
01:42:17,279 to 01:42:19,140
Crimson Dawn and the rest
of the five Syndicates
1621
01:42:19,142 to 01:42:20,673
have committed
unspeakable crimes
1622
01:42:20,675 to 01:42:21,881
across the galaxy.
1623
01:42:23,493 to 01:42:25,082
Says you.
1624
01:42:25,146 to 01:42:26,175
No.
1625
01:42:26,296 to 01:42:28,167
Says them.
1626
01:42:28,169 to 01:42:30,224
Each of our worlds
has been brutalized
1627
01:42:30,226 to 01:42:32,017
by the Syndicates.
1628
01:42:32,019 to 01:42:33,635
Crimson Dawn
will use their profits
1629
01:42:33,637 to 01:42:34,854
from the coaxium you stole
1630
01:42:34,856 to 01:42:37,312
to tyrannize
system after system
1631
01:42:37,387 to 01:42:39,482
in league with the Empire.
1632
01:42:39,484 to 01:42:41,504
And what would you
use it for?
1633
01:42:42,312 to 01:42:44,074
The same thing my mother
would have used it for
1634
01:42:44,076 to 01:42:46,612
if she had survived
and still wore the mask.
1635
01:42:48,056 to 01:42:49,284
To fight back.
1636
01:42:50,653 to 01:42:52,848
We're not marauders.
1637
01:42:53,076 to 01:42:54,811
We're allies
1638
01:42:55,509 to 01:42:57,313
and the war
has just begun.
1639
01:43:13,307 to 01:43:16,602
You know we can't give
the coaxium to Dryden Vos.
1640
01:43:16,712 to 01:43:18,726
Joining the cause,
Han Solo?
1641
01:43:18,728 to 01:43:21,122
Just trying
to make it out alive.
1642
01:43:21,291 to 01:43:22,295
Got a plan?
1643
01:43:22,297 to 01:43:23,791
Yeah, beginning of one.
1644
01:43:23,903 to 01:43:24,491
Way to get our money
1645
01:43:24,493 to 01:43:25,378
and get out from
under the thumb
1646
01:43:25,380 to 01:43:27,674
of Crimson Dawn
at the same time.
1647
01:43:27,720 to 01:43:30,239
Maybe get your girlfriend back
while we're at it.
1648
01:43:31,059 to 01:43:33,850
You don't tangle
with Dryden.
1649
01:43:33,852 to 01:43:37,181
Because unlike us,
he actually does travel
1650
01:43:37,260 to 01:43:39,943
with hired guns,
his own private army.
1651
01:43:40,438 to 01:43:42,000
So does Enfys.
1652
01:43:42,133 to 01:43:44,369
Listen, here's what
I got so far.
1653
01:43:46,416 to 01:43:48,282
What do you think
they're saying?
1654
01:43:51,806 to 01:43:53,439
He's gonna try to help you.
1655
01:43:59,256 to 01:44:00,891
I see.
1656
01:44:02,167 to 01:44:05,893
Lot of ways it could go south,
and only one where it doesn't.
1657
01:44:05,895 to 01:44:08,397
That's why I need my partner.
1658
01:44:12,650 to 01:44:14,483
Not this time.
1659
01:44:14,786 to 01:44:16,281
I'm leaving.
1660
01:44:16,283 to 01:44:18,413
If you're smart,
you'll come with me.
1661
01:44:18,549 to 01:44:20,677
I thought you didn't
believe in running.
1662
01:44:20,708 to 01:44:22,944
I prefer it to dying.
1663
01:44:50,410 to 01:44:53,007
If by some miracle
you make it out of here,
1664
01:44:53,110 to 01:44:54,611
find me on Tatooine.
1665
01:44:55,439 to 01:44:57,368
What's on Tatooine?
1666
01:44:57,370 to 01:44:58,407
Heard about a job,
1667
01:44:58,409 to 01:45:01,238
big shot gangster
putting together a crew.
1668
01:45:01,652 to 01:45:03,380
That'll be the one.
1669
01:45:03,500 to 01:45:04,358
The one?
1670
01:45:04,360 to 01:45:06,557
My last score.
1671
01:45:06,701 to 01:45:08,262
Yeah, I still got
some debts to pay
1672
01:45:08,264 to 01:45:10,865
before I can head back
to Glee Anselm
1673
01:45:11,554 to 01:45:13,555
and get into the valachord.
1674
01:45:46,922 to 01:45:48,200
Welcome home.
1675
01:45:48,202 to 01:45:50,099
He's waiting for you.
1676
01:45:50,194 to 01:45:51,194
Thanks, Toht.
1677
01:45:53,148 to 01:45:54,634
Weapons.
1678
01:45:54,636 to 01:45:55,937
I didn't bring 'em.
1679
01:45:57,576 to 01:45:58,942
They're fine.
1680
01:46:03,296 to 01:46:05,099
We're gonna win.
1681
01:46:08,147 to 01:46:10,444
It's not that kind
of game, Han.
1682
01:46:11,586 to 01:46:12,791
The object isn't to win.
1683
01:46:12,793 to 01:46:14,944
It's just to stay in it
as long as you can.
1684
01:46:18,096 to 01:46:19,565
You don't know everything.
1685
01:46:20,607 to 01:46:21,808
No.
1686
01:46:24,103 to 01:46:26,421
Just a bit more than you.
1687
01:46:34,546 to 01:46:35,534
I knew it!
1688
01:46:36,327 to 01:46:37,371
My men, they all said,
1689
01:46:37,373 to 01:46:39,727
"There's no way
they pull this off."
1690
01:46:39,729 to 01:46:41,411
"Qi'ra's not ready."
That's what they said,
1691
01:46:41,413 to 01:46:43,547
but I had faith anyway.
1692
01:46:45,533 to 01:46:46,802
Where's Beckett?
1693
01:46:46,962 to 01:46:48,264
Beckett didn't make it.
1694
01:46:52,347 to 01:46:53,212
Tell me.
1695
01:46:53,214 to 01:46:55,643
Job took a bad turn
on Kessel.
1696
01:46:56,035 to 01:46:57,856
He died saving my life.
1697
01:46:58,013 to 01:47:00,002
How are you holding up?
You all right?
1698
01:47:00,091 to 01:47:00,760
I'm okay.
1699
01:47:00,762 to 01:47:02,456
All right, good.
1700
01:47:02,747 to 01:47:04,459
Colo claw fish, anyone?
1701
01:47:04,461 to 01:47:05,828
No. Thank you.
No?
1702
01:47:05,830 to 01:47:08,423
You know, whatever Beckett's
shortcomings may have been,
1703
01:47:08,425 to 01:47:09,442
I always admired him.
1704
01:47:09,444 to 01:47:11,210
He was a man of principles.
1705
01:47:11,212 to 01:47:13,673
When he made a commitment,
he honored it
1706
01:47:13,675 to 01:47:15,996
and I think we can
all take solace
1707
01:47:15,998 to 01:47:18,472
in knowing how proud
he would've been
1708
01:47:18,474 to 01:47:22,048
to see you here,
following his example.
1709
01:47:22,108 to 01:47:23,758
Han and Chewbacca
behaved admirably.
1710
01:47:23,760 to 01:47:25,221
They'll make
reliable smugglers,
1711
01:47:25,223 to 01:47:26,552
should we ever
have the need
1712
01:47:26,554 to 01:47:28,340
when they get
their own ship.
1713
01:47:28,342 to 01:47:30,710
Qi'ra.
Come here.
1714
01:47:32,654 to 01:47:34,407
We'd really appreciate
the opportunity
1715
01:47:34,409 to 01:47:36,165
to work for you again, sir.
1716
01:47:36,167 to 01:47:37,558
I would've been
inconsolable
1717
01:47:37,560 to 01:47:39,401
if anything had
happened to you, my dear.
1718
01:47:40,683 to 01:47:42,813
I have no one else
in my life
1719
01:47:43,204 to 01:47:45,806
that I trust in the way
that I trust you.
1720
01:47:49,534 to 01:47:52,605
Well, I guess we'll just
take our payment
1721
01:47:52,607 to 01:47:53,399
and get going.
1722
01:47:53,401 to 01:47:54,523
I'm sure you've got
competitors to crush...
1723
01:47:54,525 to 01:47:55,691
What?
1724
01:47:55,693 to 01:47:57,202
...and black markets
to dominate.
1725
01:47:57,204 to 01:47:59,568
Oh. Show me what
you've brought me first.
1726
01:48:00,281 to 01:48:02,440
You want me to open it?
1727
01:48:02,442 to 01:48:04,478
Oh, yes, Han.
I really do.
1728
01:48:31,049 to 01:48:32,408
Bring me one.
1729
01:48:32,410 to 01:48:34,868
I don't think
that's a good idea, Dryden.
1730
01:48:34,870 to 01:48:37,266
It's very explosive stuff.
1731
01:48:37,817 to 01:48:40,048
I never ask
for anything twice, Han.
1732
01:49:00,738 to 01:49:02,206
Careful.
1733
01:49:06,277 to 01:49:08,111
It's magnificent.
1734
01:49:08,690 to 01:49:09,919
How'd you do it?
1735
01:49:10,037 to 01:49:10,876
Wasn't easy.
1736
01:49:10,878 to 01:49:11,871
No, I mean,
how'd you do it?
1737
01:49:11,873 to 01:49:14,970
It looks exactly
like the real thing.
1738
01:49:15,943 to 01:49:17,900
That's 'cause it is
the real thing.
1739
01:49:17,954 to 01:49:18,626
Yes, and I'm saying
1740
01:49:18,628 to 01:49:20,784
I would believe you.
It's that good.
1741
01:49:20,852 to 01:49:22,615
But my associate
already told me
1742
01:49:22,617 to 01:49:25,470
about your plan to rob me
of my money
1743
01:49:25,519 to 01:49:28,283
and give the real coaxium
to Enfys Nest.
1744
01:49:28,285 to 01:49:29,991
Dryden, I don't know
what you're thinking
1745
01:49:29,993 to 01:49:31,541
or what Qi'ra
may have told you...
1746
01:49:31,543 to 01:49:33,925
No, not Qi'ra.
Not Qi'ra.
1747
01:49:33,927 to 01:49:35,219
Qi'ra, it turns out
1748
01:49:35,284 to 01:49:36,904
has a weak spot for you,
1749
01:49:36,906 to 01:49:38,735
and we'll deal
with that later.
1750
01:49:38,737 to 01:49:42,699
No, I'm talking about
my other associate.
1751
01:49:42,739 to 01:49:44,741
Can you come in
and join us, please?
1752
01:49:56,621 to 01:49:59,756
I am sorry, kid.
1753
01:50:02,925 to 01:50:04,287
Why?
1754
01:50:04,625 to 01:50:05,453
Come on.
1755
01:50:05,493 to 01:50:07,489
Don't look at me like that.
1756
01:50:07,529 to 01:50:08,519
You weren't paying attention.
1757
01:50:08,521 to 01:50:11,283
I told you,
"Don't trust anybody."
1758
01:50:12,250 to 01:50:14,420
Am I wrong about that?
1759
01:50:16,858 to 01:50:18,005
Uhuhuh.
1760
01:50:18,621 to 01:50:20,366
Back away from that.
1761
01:50:20,368 to 01:50:22,262
Put your paws
where I can see 'em.
1762
01:50:22,400 to 01:50:24,235
Check that lid.
1763
01:50:26,380 to 01:50:27,743
Clever.
1764
01:50:27,967 to 01:50:29,679
It's too late.
1765
01:50:29,719 to 01:50:32,111
Coaxium's refined,
and Enfys has it.
1766
01:50:32,113 to 01:50:34,449
Well, we figured that.
1767
01:50:48,652 to 01:50:50,406
Drop your weapons.
1768
01:50:54,004 to 01:50:56,909
It's over.
We got them.
1769
01:50:57,067 to 01:50:58,238
And there we have it.
1770
01:50:58,240 to 01:51:00,174
Excellent work,
Aemon, thank you.
1771
01:51:00,176 to 01:51:01,896
Qi'ra, help me.
1772
01:51:04,241 to 01:51:05,575
Tell me what to do.
1773
01:51:06,644 to 01:51:08,394
What would you do
1774
01:51:08,482 to 01:51:12,520
if the person you most
trusted in the world
1775
01:51:13,094 to 01:51:14,562
betrayed you?
1776
01:51:17,314 to 01:51:18,726
I would want
to know why.
1777
01:51:20,940 to 01:51:23,102
If it was
a moment of weakness
1778
01:51:23,273 to 01:51:24,279
or something else.
1779
01:51:24,328 to 01:51:25,330
And then what?
1780
01:51:26,874 to 01:51:29,903
And then,
I would ask that person
1781
01:51:29,943 to 01:51:32,196
to prove their loyalty
1782
01:51:32,198 to 01:51:35,935
by sacrificing
something they love.
1783
01:51:44,358 to 01:51:46,489
I tried to warn you
about her.
1784
01:51:46,755 to 01:51:49,233
You know, you're wrong
about one thing.
1785
01:51:49,362 to 01:51:50,622
What?
1786
01:51:50,662 to 01:51:52,959
I was paying attention.
1787
01:51:52,999 to 01:51:55,266
You told Chewie
people are predictable.
1788
01:51:57,803 to 01:51:59,905
You're no exception.
1789
01:52:05,564 to 01:52:06,693
It's empty.
1790
01:52:06,757 to 01:52:08,200
The case is empty.
1791
01:52:08,202 to 01:52:10,611
Aemon, what's going on?
What's happening there?
1792
01:52:10,613 to 01:52:12,149
Aemon?
1793
01:52:12,212 to 01:52:13,179
Talk to me.
1794
01:52:39,153 to 01:52:41,883
I hope you didn't send
all your fancy enforcers
1795
01:52:41,885 to 01:52:43,583
because that would leave you
1796
01:52:43,585 to 01:52:46,038
a little shorthanded
around here.
1797
01:52:46,993 to 01:52:48,432
So,
1798
01:52:48,434 to 01:52:52,887
if that case is empty,
then the real coaxium...
1799
01:52:52,967 to 01:52:54,835
Leaves here
with one of us.
1800
01:52:59,901 to 01:53:01,278
Beckett,
what are you doing?
1801
01:53:01,280 to 01:53:02,328
Thinking.
1802
01:53:02,380 to 01:53:03,728
And I prefer to be
the only one
1803
01:53:03,795 to 01:53:05,619
holding a blaster
while I'm doing it.
1804
01:53:05,667 to 01:53:07,271
Han, grab that coaxium,
1805
01:53:07,273 to 01:53:08,570
put it in the case.
1806
01:53:08,572 to 01:53:10,346
Big stuff,
you're coming with me.
1807
01:53:12,054 to 01:53:13,395
Don't do this,
Beckett.
1808
01:53:13,397 to 01:53:15,191
We had a deal.
Yeah.
1809
01:53:15,193 to 01:53:16,043
I'm sorry,
1810
01:53:16,123 to 01:53:17,685
but I'm also an entrepreneur.
1811
01:53:17,687 to 01:53:20,268
I mean, you of all people
understand that.
1812
01:53:20,522 to 01:53:21,491
Come on, let's go.
1813
01:53:22,729 to 01:53:24,386
You're making
a huge mistake.
1814
01:53:24,469 to 01:53:25,731
Won't be my first.
1815
01:53:25,789 to 01:53:27,361
It's gonna be your last.
1816
01:53:27,623 to 01:53:28,791
Maybe.
1817
01:53:29,725 to 01:53:31,131
Why you gotta be
so negative?
1818
01:53:43,938 to 01:53:45,256
Han,
1819
01:53:45,258 to 01:53:46,609
now's as good a time as any
1820
01:53:46,611 to 01:53:48,704
to reevaluate
our relationship.
1821
01:53:49,224 to 01:53:50,215
How so?
1822
01:53:50,899 to 01:53:52,846
I was just thinking,
1823
01:53:52,848 to 01:53:55,845
why don't we join forces
and go get Beckett together?
1824
01:53:55,847 to 01:53:58,717
That is a great idea.
Let's do it. You go first.
1825
01:54:00,192 to 01:54:01,993
Oh, Han.
1826
01:54:28,661 to 01:54:31,021
You can't win, Han,
and even if you could,
1827
01:54:31,080 to 01:54:32,287
you'd spend
the rest of your life
1828
01:54:32,289 to 01:54:33,601
looking over your shoulder.
1829
01:54:34,691 to 01:54:35,691
You know what?
1830
01:54:36,667 to 01:54:38,623
I'm kind of getting
used to the idea.
1831
01:54:45,988 to 01:54:47,582
I'm sorry.
1832
01:54:47,654 to 01:54:49,062
Han, she's done things that
1833
01:54:49,064 to 01:54:51,861
you could never understand,
but I do.
1834
01:54:52,571 to 01:54:54,539
I understand her completely.
1835
01:54:55,426 to 01:54:57,800
Once you're a part
of Crimson Dawn,
1836
01:54:57,949 to 01:54:59,604
you can't leave.
1837
01:54:59,644 to 01:55:01,347
It's not true.
1838
01:55:01,448 to 01:55:02,875
I know you.
1839
01:55:03,080 to 01:55:05,184
It's what I was taught.
1840
01:55:05,186 to 01:55:07,074
Find your
opponent's weakness,
1841
01:55:07,185 to 01:55:08,478
and use it,
1842
01:55:08,518 to 01:55:10,621
and today...
1843
01:55:12,618 to 01:55:13,956
I'm yours.
1844
01:55:40,192 to 01:55:41,659
I had to.
1845
01:55:42,256 to 01:55:44,317
Yeah.
No, I mean, you did...
1846
01:55:44,998 to 01:55:46,934
You did.
1847
01:55:49,044 to 01:55:51,201
Beckett and Chewbacca,
you have to go after them.
1848
01:55:51,261 to 01:55:52,456
What are you gonna do?
1849
01:55:52,458 to 01:55:55,219
Well, if we give
all the coaxium to Enfys,
1850
01:55:55,324 to 01:55:57,995
we're gonna need something
to buy our ship with.
1851
01:56:11,753 to 01:56:14,382
Qi'ra...
Go and save Chewbacca.
1852
01:56:14,430 to 01:56:17,500
He needs you and you're
gonna need him, too.
1853
01:56:23,964 to 01:56:24,965
Smile.
1854
01:56:27,818 to 01:56:29,099
That's the word.
1855
01:56:30,257 to 01:56:31,410
Whenever I imagined myself
1856
01:56:31,412 to 01:56:33,348
off with you
on some adventure...
1857
01:56:34,791 to 01:56:36,858
Always makes me smile.
1858
01:56:44,333 to 01:56:46,168
Go. I'm right behind you.
1859
01:57:38,030 to 01:57:39,341
Yes?
1860
01:57:39,343 to 01:57:42,740
I regret to inform you
that Dryden Vos is dead,
1861
01:57:42,994 to 01:57:44,708
murdered by the thief
he hired
1862
01:57:44,710 to 01:57:46,313
to steal
the coaxium shipment,
1863
01:57:46,315 to 01:57:47,577
his friend,
1864
01:57:47,776 to 01:57:49,637
Tobias Beckett.
1865
01:57:49,972 to 01:57:51,753
Is that so?
1866
01:57:52,541 to 01:57:55,770
Where is the shipment now?
1867
01:57:56,147 to 01:57:57,309
Gone.
1868
01:57:57,349 to 01:57:58,346
Beckett took it.
1869
01:57:58,424 to 01:58:01,060
Slaughtered the others.
I alone survived.
1870
01:58:03,844 to 01:58:07,077
One man couldn't have
done this alone.
1871
01:58:07,930 to 01:58:09,645
I wasn't there,
1872
01:58:09,647 to 01:58:12,281
but if I had been, perhaps
I could have saved him.
1873
01:58:20,510 to 01:58:23,940
Bring the ship and
come to me on Dathomir
1874
01:58:23,942 to 01:58:25,972
and you and I
will then decide
1875
01:58:25,974 to 01:58:28,767
what to do about
the traitor, Beckett,
1876
01:58:28,823 to 01:58:31,257
and his accomplices.
1877
01:58:33,386 to 01:58:34,521
I'm on my way.
1878
01:58:37,103 to 01:58:38,332
Qi'ra,
1879
01:58:38,334 to 01:58:39,662
you and I
1880
01:58:39,664 to 01:58:42,965
will be working
much more closely
1881
01:58:43,074 to 01:58:45,042
from now on.
1882
01:59:15,139 to 01:59:17,268
You're relentless.
I'll give you that.
1883
01:59:18,666 to 01:59:20,768
Came as fast
as I could, buddy.
1884
01:59:21,272 to 01:59:22,673
Dryden dead?
1885
01:59:24,683 to 01:59:26,516
Qi'ra kill him?
1886
01:59:28,305 to 01:59:30,868
Still don't get it,
do you, kid?
1887
01:59:31,118 to 01:59:33,352
It was never about you.
1888
01:59:33,622 to 01:59:35,190
She's a survivor.
1889
01:59:36,357 to 01:59:37,913
You know what
your problem is?
1890
01:59:37,915 to 01:59:39,983
You think
everybody's like you.
1891
01:59:40,753 to 01:59:42,439
Not you, kid.
1892
01:59:42,441 to 01:59:43,877
You're nothing like me.
1893
01:59:45,884 to 01:59:47,522
I hope you're still
paying attention
1894
01:59:47,524 to 01:59:49,600
because now I'm gonna tell
you the most important...
1895
02:00:04,767 to 02:00:07,215
You made
the smart move, kid.
1896
02:00:07,217 to 02:00:08,773
For once.
1897
02:00:10,181 to 02:00:11,781
I woulda killed you.
1898
02:00:19,129 to 02:00:24,043
I really was gonna
learn to play that valachord.
1899
02:00:24,160 to 02:00:25,361
I know.
1900
02:02:18,533 to 02:02:20,013
That's it.
It's all loaded.
1901
02:02:24,024 to 02:02:25,619
Do you know
what that really is?
1902
02:02:25,682 to 02:02:26,597
Yeah.
1903
02:02:26,599 to 02:02:29,584
About 60 million credits
worth of refined coaxium.
1904
02:02:29,586 to 02:02:30,897
No.
1905
02:02:30,899 to 02:02:33,336
It's the blood that brings
life to something new.
1906
02:02:33,579 to 02:02:35,680
Yeah, what?
1907
02:02:35,682 to 02:02:36,717
A rebellion.
1908
02:02:37,917 to 02:02:39,734
You could come with us,
you know.
1909
02:02:39,736 to 02:02:42,065
We need warriors
and leaders like you.
1910
02:02:48,617 to 02:02:50,781
Maybe someday
you'll feel different.
1911
02:02:51,172 to 02:02:53,440
Don't hold your breath, kid.
1912
02:03:08,209 to 02:03:09,395
Don't lose that.
1913
02:03:21,322 to 02:03:23,283
Very few people
have actually seen
1914
02:03:23,442 to 02:03:24,792
the StarCave Nebula.
1915
02:03:24,862 to 02:03:26,161
It's breathtaking.
1916
02:03:26,186 to 02:03:27,671
Not unlike your eyes.
1917
02:03:27,829 to 02:03:29,901
How much do you know about
intertwined celestial bodies?
1918
02:03:29,903 to 02:03:32,121
Because I happen to be
something of an authority.
1919
02:03:33,073 to 02:03:34,325
By the way...
1920
02:03:40,572 to 02:03:42,001
Han!
1921
02:03:42,119 to 02:03:43,253
You're alive!
1922
02:03:43,255 to 02:03:44,581
Yeah, no thanks to you.
1923
02:03:44,583 to 02:03:46,347
I should have Chewie
rip your arms off.
1924
02:03:46,349 to 02:03:47,877
In fact, Chewie, do it.
1925
02:03:47,879 to 02:03:49,053
Hey, Han!
We are friends.
1926
02:03:49,055 to 02:03:50,769
You know that.
We're friends. All right?
1927
02:03:55,967 to 02:03:57,842
Oh, look at you.
1928
02:03:57,844 to 02:03:59,736
Thought he was gonna
rip your arms off.
1929
02:03:59,857 to 02:04:00,814
I knew you were kidding.
1930
02:04:00,816 to 02:04:01,660
No, you didn't.
1931
02:04:01,662 to 02:04:03,483
So, where's my cut?
Your cut?
1932
02:04:04,589 to 02:04:06,805
No, I don't think so.
We barely made it out alive.
1933
02:04:06,807 to 02:04:08,608
All we ended up with
was that.
1934
02:04:09,400 to 02:04:11,028
Mmmmmm.
1935
02:04:11,030 to 02:04:12,553
Figure it's worth
about 10,000,
1936
02:04:12,555 to 02:04:14,276
maybe enough
for a decent buyin.
1937
02:04:16,397 to 02:04:17,832
You want a rematch?
1938
02:04:19,202 to 02:04:20,471
Why not?
1939
02:04:24,378 to 02:04:26,339
You fold now,
1940
02:04:26,409 to 02:04:27,284
you walk away with enough
1941
02:04:27,286 to 02:04:29,381
to get yourself
your own little ship.
1942
02:04:29,997 to 02:04:31,300
You call,
1943
02:04:32,395 to 02:04:34,100
I'm gonna
clean you out again.
1944
02:04:46,625 to 02:04:47,950
I don't know,
I'm feeling lucky.
1945
02:04:50,162 to 02:04:52,758
Ooh.
1946
02:04:52,876 to 02:04:55,239
You really have it bad
for the Falcon, don't you?
1947
02:04:55,311 to 02:04:57,940
It's mutual, trust me.
She belongs with me.
1948
02:05:07,590 to 02:05:10,085
You got everything
you need there, pal?
1949
02:05:19,906 to 02:05:21,375
Not bad.
1950
02:05:21,750 to 02:05:24,391
Not bad. You know,
1951
02:05:24,393 to 02:05:28,237
if you'd only had
this little green sylop,
1952
02:05:28,239 to 02:05:29,735
you would've beaten this.
1953
02:05:35,586 to 02:05:38,553
Fair and square, baby.
Fair and square.
1954
02:05:49,247 to 02:05:50,775
Beckett said
he heard about this
1955
02:05:50,777 to 02:05:53,065
very big gangster
putting together a job.
1956
02:05:53,854 to 02:05:56,021
No, I'm telling ya,
1957
02:05:56,102 to 02:05:57,390
it's gonna be great.
1958
02:05:57,503 to 02:05:59,373
When have I ever
steered you wrong?
