1
00:02:16,637 to 00:02:19,347
Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.
2
00:02:19,432 to 00:02:21,599
Very good, Lieutenant.
3
00:03:13,277 to 00:03:15,153
We made it.
4
00:03:18,574 to 00:03:20,325
I guess I was wrong.
5
00:03:20,409 to 00:03:22,660
There was no danger at all.
6
00:03:41,472 to 00:03:43,139
Cordé.
7
00:03:44,475 to 00:03:47,477
Milady, I'm so sorry.
8
00:03:48,312 to 00:03:50,438
I've failed you, Senator.
9
00:03:50,523 to 00:03:51,689
No.
10
00:03:54,819 to 00:03:57,362
Milady, you're still in danger here.
11
00:04:03,828 to 00:04:07,288
I shouldn't have come back.
This vote is very important.
12
00:04:07,373 to 00:04:11,042
You did your duty.
Cordé did hers. Now, come.
13
00:04:12,878 to 00:04:15,004
Senator Amidala, please.
14
00:04:26,559 to 00:04:29,686
I don't know how much longer
I can hold off the vote, my friends.
15
00:04:30,479 to 00:04:33,314
More and more star systems
are joining the separatists.
16
00:04:33,399 to 00:04:35,275
If they do break away...
17
00:04:35,359 to 00:04:38,611
I will not let this Republic
that has stood for a thousand years...
18
00:04:38,696 to 00:04:40,780
be split in two.
19
00:04:40,865 to 00:04:44,117
My negotiations will not fail.
20
00:04:44,201 to 00:04:46,578
If they do, you must realize...
21
00:04:46,662 to 00:04:48,746
there aren't enough Jedi
to protect the Republic.
22
00:04:49,665 to 00:04:52,375
We're keepers of the peace, not soldiers.
23
00:04:53,836 to 00:04:55,545
Master Yoda...
24
00:04:56,463 to 00:04:59,215
do you think it will really come to war?
25
00:05:00,676 to 00:05:04,971
The dark side clouds everything.
26
00:05:05,055 to 00:05:10,059
Impossible to see the future is.
27
00:05:11,896 to 00:05:15,148
The Loyalist Committee
has arrived, Your Honor.
28
00:05:15,232 to 00:05:16,232
Good.
29
00:05:18,736 to 00:05:20,904
Send them in.
30
00:05:20,988 to 00:05:23,907
We will discuss this matter later.
31
00:05:28,037 to 00:05:31,956
Senator Amidala, your tragedy
on the landing platform...
32
00:05:32,041 to 00:05:34,125
terrible.
33
00:05:34,210 to 00:05:37,837
Seeing you alive brings
warm feelings to my heart.
34
00:05:37,922 to 00:05:40,673
Do you have any idea
who was behind this attack?
35
00:05:40,758 to 00:05:45,428
Our intelligence points to disgruntled
spice miners on the moons of Naboo.
36
00:05:46,263 to 00:05:48,348
I think that Count Dooku was behind it.
37
00:05:48,432 to 00:05:52,352
He is a political idealist, not a murderer.
38
00:05:52,436 to 00:05:55,480
You know, milady, Count
Dooku was once a Jedi.
39
00:05:55,564 to 00:05:59,025
He couldn't assassinate anyone.
It's not in his character.
40
00:05:59,109 to 00:06:01,694
But for certain, Senator...
41
00:06:01,779 to 00:06:05,657
in grave danger you are.
42
00:06:06,784 to 00:06:09,702
Master Jedi, may I suggest...
43
00:06:09,787 to 00:06:13,915
the senator be placed under
the protection of your graces?
44
00:06:13,999 to 00:06:17,085
Do you really think that's a wise
decision under these stressful times?
45
00:06:17,169 to 00:06:19,295
Chancellor, if I may comment,
I do not believe...
46
00:06:19,380 to 00:06:21,798
The situation is that serious?
47
00:06:22,299 to 00:06:24,300
No, but I do, Senator.
48
00:06:24,385 to 00:06:27,762
I realize all too well
that additional security...
49
00:06:27,846 to 00:06:31,349
might be disruptive for you...
50
00:06:31,433 to 00:06:34,394
but perhaps someone you're familiar with.
51
00:06:34,478 to 00:06:38,314
An old friend, like Master Kenobi.
52
00:06:39,149 to 00:06:40,650
That's possible.
53
00:06:40,734 to 00:06:43,528
He's just returned
from a border dispute on Ansion.
54
00:06:44,655 to 00:06:46,823
Do it for me, milady. Please?
55
00:06:46,907 to 00:06:49,325
The thought of losing you...
56
00:06:51,036 to 00:06:53,162
is unbearable.
57
00:06:53,831 to 00:06:57,166
I will have Obi-Wan
report to you immediately, milady.
58
00:06:57,251 to 00:06:59,544
Thank you, Master Windu.
59
00:07:08,679 to 00:07:12,432
You seem a little on edge.
Not at all.
60
00:07:12,516 to 00:07:16,185
I haven't felt you this tense since
we fell into that nest of gundarks.
61
00:07:16,895 to 00:07:18,938
You fell into that nightmare, Master...
62
00:07:19,023 to 00:07:21,816
and I rescued you, remember?
63
00:07:21,900 to 00:07:23,985
Oh... yes.
64
00:07:29,366 to 00:07:33,494
You're sweating. Relax. Take a deep breath.
65
00:07:34,496 to 00:07:36,706
I haven't seen her in ten years, Master.
66
00:07:51,347 to 00:07:54,098
Obi? Obi!
67
00:07:54,183 to 00:07:57,852
Mesa so smilen to seein yousa!
Good to see you again, Jar Jar.
68
00:07:57,936 to 00:07:59,937
Senator Padmé.
69
00:08:00,022 to 00:08:03,649
Mesa palos here! Lookie, lookie, Senator.
70
00:08:03,734 to 00:08:06,527
Desa Jedi arriven.
71
00:08:10,366 to 00:08:13,076
It's a great pleasure
to see you again, milady.
72
00:08:13,160 to 00:08:15,703
It has been far too long, Master Kenobi.
73
00:08:17,039 to 00:08:18,456
Ani?
74
00:08:18,540 to 00:08:21,876
My goodness, you've grown.
So have you.
75
00:08:21,960 to 00:08:24,379
Grown more beautiful, I mean.
76
00:08:24,463 to 00:08:27,215
Well, for a senator, I mean.
77
00:08:29,551 to 00:08:32,720
Ani, you'll always be that little boy
I knew on Tatooine.
78
00:08:34,264 to 00:08:37,725
Our presence here will be invisible,
milady, I can assure you.
79
00:08:37,810 to 00:08:40,311
I'm Captain Typho
of Her Majesty's security service.
80
00:08:40,396 to 00:08:42,480
Queen Jamillia has been informed
of your assignment.
81
00:08:42,564 to 00:08:44,690
I am grateful you are here, Master Kenobi.
82
00:08:44,775 to 00:08:47,568
The situation is more dangerous
than the senator will admit.
83
00:08:47,653 to 00:08:50,363
I don't need more security. I need answers.
84
00:08:50,447 to 00:08:52,698
I want to know who's trying to kill me.
85
00:08:52,783 to 00:08:56,661
We are here to protect you,
Senator, not to start an investigation.
86
00:08:56,745 to 00:08:59,122
We will find out
who's trying to kill you, Padmé.
87
00:08:59,206 to 00:09:01,082
I promise you.
88
00:09:01,166 to 00:09:03,918
We will not exceed our mandate,
my young Padawan learner.
89
00:09:04,002 to 00:09:06,963
I meant that in the interest
of protecting her, Master, of course.
90
00:09:07,047 to 00:09:09,590
We will not go through
this exercise again, Anakin...
91
00:09:09,675 to 00:09:11,676
and you will pay attention to my lead.
92
00:09:11,760 to 00:09:13,845
Why?
What?
93
00:09:15,681 to 00:09:19,434
Why else do you think we were assigned
to her if not to find the killer?
94
00:09:19,518 to 00:09:22,854
Protection is a job
for local security, not Jedi.
95
00:09:22,938 to 00:09:25,773
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our mandate.
96
00:09:25,858 to 00:09:29,152
We will do exactly
as the council has instructed.
97
00:09:31,613 to 00:09:34,657
And you will learn your place, young one.
98
00:09:38,120 to 00:09:40,204
Perhaps with merely your presence...
99
00:09:40,289 to 00:09:43,207
the mystery surrounding
this threat will be revealed.
100
00:09:43,292 to 00:09:46,085
Now, if you'll excuse me...
101
00:09:46,170 to 00:09:47,879
I will retire.
102
00:09:49,214 to 00:09:51,257
I know I'll feel better having you here.
103
00:09:51,341 to 00:09:53,009
I'll have an officer stationed
on every floor...
104
00:09:53,093 to 00:09:55,845
and I'll be in the control
center downstairs.
105
00:09:57,473 to 00:10:00,475
Mesa busten wit happiness
seein yousa again, Ani.
106
00:10:00,559 to 00:10:03,728
She hardly even recognized me, Jar Jar.
107
00:10:05,355 to 00:10:08,316
I've thought about her
every day since we parted...
108
00:10:09,651 to 00:10:11,611
and she's forgotten me completely.
109
00:10:11,695 to 00:10:15,907
Shesa happy.
Happier den mesa seein her in a longo time.
110
00:10:15,991 to 00:10:19,994
You're focusing on the negative, Anakin.
Be mindful of your thoughts.
111
00:10:20,078 to 00:10:22,580
She was pleased to see us.
112
00:10:22,664 to 00:10:24,665
Now, let's check the security.
113
00:10:33,550 to 00:10:35,760
I hit the ship, but they used a decoy.
114
00:10:35,844 to 00:10:38,137
We'll have to try something
more subtle this time, Zam.
115
00:10:38,222 to 00:10:40,223
My client is getting impatient.
116
00:10:40,307 to 00:10:43,184
Take these. Be careful.
They're very poisonous.
117
00:10:43,268 to 00:10:46,729
And, Zam, there can be
no mistakes this time.
118
00:10:50,067 to 00:10:52,485
Captain Typho has
more than enough men downstairs.
119
00:10:52,569 to 00:10:54,570
No assassin would try that way.
120
00:10:55,072 to 00:10:57,698
Any activity up here?
Quiet as a tomb.
121
00:10:59,201 to 00:11:02,328
I don't like just waiting here
for something to happen to her.
122
00:11:02,412 to 00:11:05,706
What's going on?
She covered the cameras.
123
00:11:06,375 to 00:11:08,459
I don't think she liked me watching her.
124
00:11:08,544 to 00:11:10,461
What is she thinking?
125
00:11:10,546 to 00:11:13,548
She programmed R2 to warn us
if there is an intruder.
126
00:11:13,632 to 00:11:16,259
There are many other
ways to kill a senator.
127
00:11:16,343 to 00:11:20,763
I know, but we also want to catch
this assassin, don't we, Master?
128
00:11:22,808 to 00:11:24,934
You're using her as bait.
129
00:11:25,018 to 00:11:27,144
It was her idea.
130
00:11:27,229 to 00:11:29,814
Don't worry. No harm will come to her.
131
00:11:29,898 to 00:11:32,858
I can sense everything
going on in that room.
132
00:11:32,943 to 00:11:35,236
Trust me.
133
00:11:35,320 to 00:11:37,655
It's too risky.
134
00:11:37,739 to 00:11:41,242
Besides, your senses aren't that attuned,
my young apprentice.
135
00:11:41,326 to 00:11:43,411
And yours are?
136
00:11:45,581 to 00:11:47,456
Possibly.
137
00:12:01,805 to 00:12:03,806
You look tired.
138
00:12:04,474 to 00:12:06,475
I don't sleep well anymore.
139
00:12:06,560 to 00:12:09,145
Because of your mother?
140
00:12:14,276 to 00:12:17,111
I don't know why I keep dreaming about her.
141
00:12:19,823 to 00:12:21,782
Dreams pass in time.
142
00:12:23,285 to 00:12:25,870
I'd much rather dream about Padmé.
143
00:12:25,954 to 00:12:30,207
Just being around her again is...
intoxicating.
144
00:12:30,292 to 00:12:32,752
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin.
They betray you.
145
00:12:32,836 to 00:12:35,212
You've made a commitment
to the Jedi order...
146
00:12:35,297 to 00:12:37,381
a commitment not easily broken.
147
00:12:37,466 to 00:12:40,217
And don't forget, she's a politician.
They're not to be trusted.
148
00:12:40,302 to 00:12:42,928
She's not like the others
in the senate, Master.
149
00:12:43,013 to 00:12:45,222
It is my experience that senators focus...
150
00:12:45,307 to 00:12:48,184
only on pleasing those
who fund their campaigns...
151
00:12:48,894 to 00:12:52,480
and they're in no means scared of
forgetting the niceties of democracy...
152
00:12:52,564 to 00:12:54,774
in order to get those funds.
Not another lecture.
153
00:12:54,858 to 00:12:57,693
At least not on the economics of politics.
154
00:13:53,291 to 00:13:56,043
And besides, you're generalizing.
155
00:13:56,128 to 00:13:58,212
The chancellor doesn't
appear to be corrupt.
156
00:13:58,296 to 00:13:59,964
Palpatine is a politician.
157
00:14:00,048 to 00:14:02,717
I have observed that he is very clever...
158
00:14:02,801 to 00:14:06,804
in following the passions
and the prejudices of the senators.
159
00:14:06,888 to 00:14:08,806
I think he's a good man...
160
00:14:08,890 to 00:14:10,808
I sense it too.
161
00:14:27,284 to 00:14:29,994
Stay here!
162
00:14:32,414 to 00:14:34,331
Are you all right, milady?
163
00:15:08,742 to 00:15:09,992
What the...
164
00:15:18,585 to 00:15:20,336
Jedi poo doo!
165
00:16:22,107 to 00:16:24,441
What took you so long?
Oh, you know, Master.
166
00:16:24,526 to 00:16:27,444
I couldn't find a speeder I liked...
There he is.
167
00:16:27,529 to 00:16:30,906
with the open cockpit
and the right speed capabilities.
168
00:16:30,991 to 00:16:33,826
If you spent as long practicing your
saber techniques as you do your wit...
169
00:16:33,910 to 00:16:35,661
you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman.
170
00:16:35,745 to 00:16:37,454
I thought I already did.
171
00:16:37,539 to 00:16:40,291
Only in your mind, my
very young apprentice.
172
00:17:08,737 to 00:17:11,238
Pull up, Anakin. Pull up!
173
00:17:18,288 to 00:17:20,497
You know I don't like it when you do that.
174
00:17:20,582 to 00:17:23,792
Sorry, Master.
I forgot you don't like flying.
175
00:17:23,877 to 00:17:26,754
I don't mind flying,
but what you're doing is suicide!
176
00:17:54,991 to 00:17:57,993
Anakin! How many times have I told you...
177
00:17:58,078 to 00:18:00,287
stay away from power couplings!
178
00:18:02,958 to 00:18:04,333
That was good!
179
00:18:19,641 to 00:18:22,434
Where are you going? He went that way.
180
00:18:22,519 to 00:18:24,561
Master, if we keep this chase
going any longer...
181
00:18:24,646 to 00:18:26,647
that creep is gonna end up deep-fried...
182
00:18:26,731 to 00:18:31,068
and, personally, I'd like to find out
who he is and who he's working for.
183
00:18:31,152 to 00:18:33,862
This is a shortcut... I think.
184
00:19:01,599 to 00:19:03,517
Well, you've lost him.
185
00:19:04,019 to 00:19:06,103
I'm deeply sorry, Master.
186
00:19:06,187 to 00:19:08,105
That was some shortcut, Anakin.
187
00:19:08,189 to 00:19:10,607
He went completely the other way.
188
00:19:10,692 to 00:19:12,776
Once again you've proved...
If you'll excuse me.
189
00:19:15,280 to 00:19:17,906
I hate it when he does that.
190
00:21:46,890 to 00:21:48,682
Anakin!
191
00:21:48,766 to 00:21:51,643
She went into the club, Master.
Patience.
192
00:21:51,728 to 00:21:54,730
Use the Force. Think.
Sorry, Master.
193
00:21:54,814 to 00:21:58,108
He went in there to hide, not to run.
Yes, Master.
194
00:21:58,193 to 00:22:01,028
Next time, try not to lose it.
Yes, Master.
195
00:22:01,112 to 00:22:05,073
This weapon is your life.
I try, Master.
196
00:22:05,158 to 00:22:07,868
Why do I get the feeling
you're going to be the death of me?
197
00:22:07,952 to 00:22:09,661
Don't say that, Master.
198
00:22:09,746 to 00:22:11,830
You're the closest thing
I have to a father.
199
00:22:11,915 to 00:22:13,832
Then why don't you listen to me?
200
00:22:13,917 to 00:22:15,542
I am trying.
201
00:22:27,597 to 00:22:29,556
Can you see him?
202
00:22:29,641 to 00:22:31,642
I think he is a she...
203
00:22:31,726 to 00:22:34,436
and I think she is a changeling.
204
00:22:34,979 to 00:22:37,648
In that case, be extra careful.
205
00:22:39,651 to 00:22:42,110
Go and find her.
Where are you going, Master?
206
00:22:42,195 to 00:22:43,737
For a drink.
207
00:22:54,290 to 00:22:56,124
Thank you.
208
00:22:57,293 to 00:23:00,337
You wanna buy some death sticks?
You don't want to sell me death sticks.
209
00:23:00,421 to 00:23:02,089
I don't want to sell you death sticks.
210
00:23:02,173 to 00:23:03,924
You want to go home and rethink your life.
211
00:23:04,008 to 00:23:06,301
I want to go home and rethink my life.
212
00:23:55,184 to 00:23:56,476
Easy.
213
00:23:56,561 to 00:23:58,729
Jedi business. Go back to your drinks.
214
00:24:05,361 to 00:24:08,030
Do you know who it was
you were trying to kill?
215
00:24:08,656 to 00:24:10,407
It was a senator from Naboo.
216
00:24:10,491 to 00:24:13,201
And who hired you?
It was just a job.
217
00:24:14,329 to 00:24:16,580
Who hired you? Tell us.
218
00:24:18,041 to 00:24:20,083
Tell us now!
219
00:24:21,044 to 00:24:22,878
It was a bounty hunter called...
220
00:24:28,134 to 00:24:32,679
Wee shahnit... sleemo.
221
00:24:42,231 to 00:24:44,066
Toxic dart.
222
00:24:54,452 to 00:24:58,538
Track down this bounty hunter
you must, Obi-Wan.
223
00:24:58,623 to 00:25:02,084
Most importantly,
find out who he's working for.
224
00:25:02,168 to 00:25:06,088
What about Senator Amidala?
She will still need protecting.
225
00:25:06,172 to 00:25:09,132
Handle that your Padawan will.
226
00:25:10,843 to 00:25:14,513
Anakin, escort the senator
back to her home planet of Naboo.
227
00:25:14,597 to 00:25:18,350
She'll be safer there.
And don't use registered transport.
228
00:25:18,434 to 00:25:20,435
Travel as refugees.
229
00:25:20,520 to 00:25:23,480
As the leader of the opposition,
it will be very difficult...
230
00:25:23,564 to 00:25:25,941
to get Senator Amidala
to leave the capital.
231
00:25:26,901 to 00:25:29,736
Until caught this killer is...
232
00:25:29,821 to 00:25:33,240
our judgment she must respect.
233
00:25:33,324 to 00:25:35,450
Anakin, go to the senate...
234
00:25:35,535 to 00:25:38,787
and ask Chancellor Palpatine
to speak with her about this matter.
235
00:25:47,630 to 00:25:49,589
I will talk with her.
236
00:25:49,674 to 00:25:52,843
Senator Amidala will not refuse
an executive order.
237
00:25:52,927 to 00:25:55,095
I know her well enough
to assure you of that.
238
00:25:55,179 to 00:25:57,264
Thank you, Your Excellency.
239
00:25:57,348 to 00:26:00,767
And so, they've finally
given you an assignment.
240
00:26:01,811 to 00:26:03,854
Your patience has paid off.
241
00:26:03,938 to 00:26:06,314
Your guidance more than my patience.
242
00:26:07,400 to 00:26:09,818
You don't need guidance, Anakin.
243
00:26:11,112 to 00:26:14,156
In time, you will learn
to trust your feelings.
244
00:26:16,033 to 00:26:18,160
Then you will be invincible.
245
00:26:21,289 to 00:26:23,206
I have said it many times:
246
00:26:23,291 to 00:26:26,084
You are the most gifted
Jedi I have ever met.
247
00:26:26,169 to 00:26:28,086
Thank you, Your Excellency.
248
00:26:28,171 to 00:26:31,882
I see you becoming the greatest
of all the Jedi, Anakin...
249
00:26:31,966 to 00:26:34,509
even more powerful than Master Yoda.
250
00:26:39,682 to 00:26:41,725
I am concerned for my Padawan.
251
00:26:41,809 to 00:26:44,561
He is not ready to be given
this assignment on his own yet.
252
00:26:44,645 to 00:26:47,898
The council is confident
in its decision, Obi-Wan.
253
00:26:47,982 to 00:26:49,941
The boy has exceptional skills.
254
00:26:50,026 to 00:26:52,486
But he still has much to learn, Master.
255
00:26:52,570 to 00:26:56,072
His abilities have made
him, well, arrogant.
256
00:26:56,157 to 00:26:58,116
Yes.
257
00:26:58,201 to 00:27:01,203
A flaw more and more common among Jedi.
258
00:27:03,080 to 00:27:05,665
Too sure of themselves they are.
259
00:27:05,750 to 00:27:09,211
Even the older, more experienced ones.
260
00:27:09,295 to 00:27:12,923
Remember, Obi-Wan, if
the prophecy is true...
261
00:27:13,007 to 00:27:16,676
your apprentice is the only one who can
bring the Force back into balance.
262
00:27:20,723 to 00:27:23,600
I'm taking an extended leave of absence.
263
00:27:23,684 to 00:27:26,811
It will be your responsibility
to take my place in the senate.
264
00:27:26,896 to 00:27:29,814
Representative Binks,
I know I can count on you.
265
00:27:29,899 to 00:27:34,694
Mesa honored to be taking on
dissa heavy burden.
266
00:27:34,779 to 00:27:39,074
Mesa accept this with muy,
muy humility and...
267
00:27:39,158 to 00:27:41,785
Jar Jar, I don't wish to hold you up.
268
00:27:41,869 to 00:27:43,828
I'm sure you have a great deal to do.
269
00:27:43,913 to 00:27:45,956
Of course.
270
00:27:46,040 to 00:27:47,624
Milady.
271
00:27:52,213 to 00:27:54,089
I do not like this idea of hiding.
272
00:27:55,049 to 00:27:56,299
Don't worry.
273
00:27:56,384 to 00:27:58,635
Now that the council
has ordered an investigation...
274
00:27:58,719 to 00:28:01,388
it won't take Master Obi-Wan long
to find this bounty hunter.
275
00:28:01,472 to 00:28:04,391
I haven't worked for a year
to defeat the Military Creation Act...
276
00:28:04,475 to 00:28:06,560
to not be here when its fate is decided.
277
00:28:06,644 to 00:28:08,728
Sometimes we must let go of our pride...
278
00:28:08,813 to 00:28:10,772
and do what is requested of us.
279
00:28:10,856 to 00:28:13,942
Anakin, you've grown up.
280
00:28:15,778 to 00:28:18,280
Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it.
281
00:28:24,954 to 00:28:29,666
Don't get me wrong.
Obi-Wan is a great mentor.
282
00:28:29,750 to 00:28:32,335
As wise as Master Yoda and...
283
00:28:32,420 to 00:28:34,588
as powerful as Master Windu.
284
00:28:36,924 to 00:28:39,342
I am truly thankful to be his apprentice.
285
00:28:41,470 to 00:28:44,598
In some ways... a lot of ways...
286
00:28:46,601 to 00:28:48,602
I'm really ahead of him.
287
00:28:49,312 to 00:28:51,146
I'm ready for the trials...
288
00:28:51,230 to 00:28:54,691
but he feels that I'm too unpredictable.
289
00:28:54,775 to 00:28:56,693
He won't let me move on.
290
00:28:57,528 to 00:28:59,863
That must be frustrating.
It's worse.
291
00:28:59,947 to 00:29:02,741
He's overly critical. He never listens.
292
00:29:02,825 to 00:29:05,201
He doesn't understand.
293
00:29:05,286 to 00:29:07,412
It's not fair!
294
00:29:07,496 to 00:29:12,375
All mentors have a way of seeing
more of our faults than we would like.
295
00:29:12,460 to 00:29:14,502
It's the only way we grow.
296
00:29:16,547 to 00:29:18,006
I know.
297
00:29:18,924 to 00:29:21,009
Anakin...
298
00:29:23,346 to 00:29:25,847
don't try to grow up too fast.
299
00:29:25,931 to 00:29:28,016
But I am grown up.
300
00:29:30,061 to 00:29:32,062
You said it yourself.
301
00:29:33,147 to 00:29:35,315
Please don't look at me like that.
302
00:29:36,233 to 00:29:37,734
Why not?
303
00:29:37,818 to 00:29:40,028
It makes me feel uncomfortable.
304
00:29:41,989 to 00:29:43,990
Sorry, milady.
305
00:29:59,215 to 00:30:02,008
Be safe, milady.
Thank you, Captain.
306
00:30:02,093 to 00:30:05,178
Take good care of Dormé.
The threat's on you two now.
307
00:30:05,262 to 00:30:07,263
He'll be safe with me.
308
00:30:11,686 to 00:30:13,311
You'll be fine.
309
00:30:13,396 to 00:30:16,648
It's not me, milady. I worry about you.
310
00:30:16,732 to 00:30:19,067
What if they realize
you've left the capital?
311
00:30:20,236 to 00:30:23,530
Well, then my Jedi protector
will have to prove how good he is.
312
00:30:23,614 to 00:30:25,532
Anakin...
313
00:30:25,616 to 00:30:28,743
don't do anything without first
consulting either myself or the council.
314
00:30:28,828 to 00:30:30,787
Yes, Master.
315
00:30:31,914 to 00:30:34,499
I'll get to the bottom
of this plot quickly, milady.
316
00:30:34,583 to 00:30:36,501
You'll be back here in no time.
317
00:30:36,585 to 00:30:39,838
I'll be most grateful
for your speed, Master Jedi.
318
00:30:39,922 to 00:30:41,840
It's time to go.
I know.
319
00:30:41,924 to 00:30:44,509
Anakin, may the Force be with you.
320
00:30:44,593 to 00:30:46,636
May the Force be with you, Master.
321
00:30:58,107 to 00:30:59,983
Suddenly I'm afraid.
322
00:31:00,067 to 00:31:03,737
This is my first assignment on my own.
I am too.
323
00:31:06,115 to 00:31:08,283
Don't worry. We have R2 with us.
324
00:31:13,539 to 00:31:16,166
I do hope he doesn't try anything foolish.
325
00:31:16,917 to 00:31:20,420
I'd be more concerned about her
doing something than him.
326
00:31:41,817 to 00:31:44,235
Someone to see ya, honey!
327
00:31:44,320 to 00:31:46,279
Jedi, by the looks of him.
328
00:31:47,239 to 00:31:48,948
Obi-Wan!
329
00:31:49,992 to 00:31:51,284
Hello, Dex.
330
00:31:51,368 to 00:31:53,995
Take a seat. I'll be right with ya.
331
00:31:56,373 to 00:31:59,375
You wanna cup o' jawa juice?
Oh, yes. Thank you.
332
00:32:04,006 to 00:32:06,216
Old buddy!
333
00:32:15,476 to 00:32:18,561
So, my friend, what can I do for ya?
334
00:32:18,646 to 00:32:20,522
You can tell me what this is.
335
00:32:21,982 to 00:32:25,235
Well, whattaya know!
336
00:32:25,319 to 00:32:27,695
I ain't seen one of these
since I was prospectin'...
337
00:32:27,780 to 00:32:31,074
on Subterrel, beyond the outer rim.
338
00:32:31,158 to 00:32:33,618
Can you tell me where it came from?
339
00:32:33,702 to 00:32:36,663
This baby belongs to them cloners.
340
00:32:36,747 to 00:32:41,084
What you got here is a Kamino saberdart.
341
00:32:41,168 to 00:32:44,170
I wonder why it didn't show up
in the analysis archives.
342
00:32:44,255 to 00:32:47,590
It's these funny little cuts on the side
that give it away.
343
00:32:47,675 to 00:32:51,636
Those analysis droids
only focus on symbols.
344
00:32:51,720 to 00:32:53,972
I should think that you Jedi
would have more respect...
345
00:32:54,056 to 00:32:56,432
for the difference between knowledge and...
346
00:32:57,560 to 00:32:59,269
wisdom.
347
00:32:59,353 to 00:33:01,062
Well, if droids could think...
348
00:33:01,146 to 00:33:03,064
there'd be none of us here, would there?
349
00:33:04,233 to 00:33:06,484
Kamino. I'm not familiar with it.
Is it in the Republic?
350
00:33:06,569 to 00:33:08,528
No, no. It's beyond the outer rim.
351
00:33:08,612 to 00:33:14,033
I'd say about 12 parsecs
outside the Rishi Maze.
352
00:33:14,118 to 00:33:18,913
Should be easy to find,
even for those droids in your archives.
353
00:33:19,748 to 00:33:24,627
These Kaminoans keep to themselves.
354
00:33:24,712 to 00:33:27,589
They're cloners. Damn good ones too.
355
00:33:28,674 to 00:33:32,176
Cloners. Are they friendly?
Depends.
356
00:33:32,261 to 00:33:34,178
Depends on what, Dex?
357
00:33:34,263 to 00:33:37,181
On how good your manners are...
358
00:33:37,266 to 00:33:41,603
and how big your... pocketbook is.
359
00:33:52,281 to 00:33:54,991
Did you call for assistance?
Yes, I did.
360
00:33:55,075 to 00:33:57,243
Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi?
361
00:33:57,328 to 00:34:00,663
Yes, I'm looking for a planetary system
called Kamino.
362
00:34:00,748 to 00:34:03,041
It doesn't show up on the archive charts.
363
00:34:03,125 to 00:34:07,420
Kamino. It's not a system
I'm familiar with.
364
00:34:07,504 to 00:34:09,881
Are you sure you have
the right coordinates?
365
00:34:09,965 to 00:34:13,009
According to my information, it should
appear in this quadrant here...
366
00:34:13,093 to 00:34:15,178
just south of the Rishi Maze.
367
00:34:22,102 to 00:34:25,438
I hate to say it, but it looks like
the system you're searching for...
368
00:34:25,522 to 00:34:27,231
doesn't exist.
369
00:34:27,316 to 00:34:30,860
Impossible.
Perhaps the archives are incomplete.
370
00:34:30,945 to 00:34:34,030
If an item does not
appear in our records...
371
00:34:34,114 to 00:34:36,199
it does not exist.
372
00:34:57,888 to 00:35:00,473
Hey, you! No droids!
373
00:35:00,557 to 00:35:02,517
Get outta here!
374
00:35:09,316 to 00:35:11,192
Thank you, R2.
375
00:35:11,986 to 00:35:14,904
Must be difficult,
having sworn your life to the Jedi...
376
00:35:14,989 to 00:35:18,908
not being able to visit the places
you like or do the things you like.
377
00:35:18,993 to 00:35:21,160
Or be with the people that I love.
378
00:35:22,037 to 00:35:24,122
Are you allowed to love?
379
00:35:24,206 to 00:35:26,040
I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.
380
00:35:29,545 to 00:35:31,879
Attachment is forbidden.
381
00:35:33,674 to 00:35:35,591
Possession is forbidden.
382
00:35:35,676 to 00:35:39,262
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love...
383
00:35:39,346 to 00:35:41,848
is central to a Jedi's life.
384
00:35:44,268 to 00:35:48,646
So you might say that
we are encouraged to love.
385
00:35:48,731 to 00:35:50,690
You've changed so much.
386
00:35:50,774 to 00:35:53,359
You haven't changed a bit.
387
00:35:53,444 to 00:35:56,362
You're exactly the way
I remember you in my dreams.
388
00:36:08,834 to 00:36:12,712
Reach out. Sense the Force around you.
389
00:36:12,796 to 00:36:15,548
Use your feelings you must.
390
00:36:19,845 to 00:36:22,972
Younglings. Younglings!
391
00:36:23,057 to 00:36:25,475
A visitor we have.
392
00:36:25,559 to 00:36:28,478
Hello, Master Obi-Wan.
393
00:36:28,562 to 00:36:30,021
Hello.
394
00:36:30,105 to 00:36:31,647
I'm sorry to disturb you, Master.
395
00:36:31,732 to 00:36:34,108
What help can I be, Obi-Wan?
396
00:36:35,527 to 00:36:38,446
I'm looking for a planet
described to me by an old friend.
397
00:36:38,530 to 00:36:41,741
I trust him, but the systems don't show
on the archive maps.
398
00:36:43,285 to 00:36:46,162
Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has.
399
00:36:46,246 to 00:36:50,291
How embarrassing. How embarrassing!
400
00:36:51,627 to 00:36:53,669
Liam, the shades.
401
00:36:55,005 to 00:36:57,507
Gather round the map reader.
402
00:36:57,591 to 00:36:59,550
Clear your minds...
403
00:36:59,635 to 00:37:03,346
and find Obi-Wan's wayward planet we will.
404
00:37:04,515 to 00:37:07,725
It ought to be here...
405
00:37:07,810 to 00:37:09,727
but it isn't.
406
00:37:09,812 to 00:37:13,272
Gravity is pulling all the stars
in the area towards this spot.
407
00:37:14,817 to 00:37:16,943
Gravity's silhouette remains...
408
00:37:17,027 to 00:37:20,029
but the star and all the planets...
409
00:37:20,114 to 00:37:22,115
disappeared they have.
410
00:37:22,199 to 00:37:24,367
How can this be?
411
00:37:25,536 to 00:37:27,203
A thought?
412
00:37:28,080 to 00:37:30,373
Anyone.
413
00:37:30,457 to 00:37:31,874
Master?
414
00:37:31,959 to 00:37:34,877
Because someone erased it
from the archive memory.
415
00:37:38,173 to 00:37:42,135
Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.
416
00:37:45,013 to 00:37:47,223
The Padawan is right.
417
00:37:47,307 to 00:37:50,393
Go to the center of gravity's pull...
418
00:37:50,477 to 00:37:54,021
and find your planet you will.
419
00:37:59,278 to 00:38:02,738
The data must have been erased.
420
00:38:02,823 to 00:38:07,577
But who could empty information from
the archives? Isn't that impossible?
421
00:38:07,661 to 00:38:11,080
Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is.
422
00:38:11,165 to 00:38:15,585
Only a Jedi could have erased those files.
423
00:38:15,669 to 00:38:19,088
But who and why, harder to answer.
424
00:38:20,007 to 00:38:23,050
Meditate on this I will.
425
00:38:47,743 to 00:38:50,161
I wasn't the youngest queen ever elected...
426
00:38:50,245 to 00:38:53,873
but now that I think back on it,
I'm not sure I was old enough.
427
00:38:53,957 to 00:38:55,958
I'm not sure I was ready.
428
00:38:56,043 to 00:38:58,878
The people you served
thought you did a good job.
429
00:38:58,962 to 00:39:01,047
I heard they even tried
to amend the constitution...
430
00:39:01,131 to 00:39:03,216
so you could stay in office.
431
00:39:03,300 to 00:39:05,801
I was relieved when my two terms were up.
432
00:39:05,886 to 00:39:09,639
But when the queen asked me
to serve as senator...
433
00:39:09,723 to 00:39:11,891
I couldn't refuse her.
434
00:39:11,975 to 00:39:15,394
I agree with her.
I think the Republic needs you.
435
00:39:17,439 to 00:39:19,607
I'm glad that you chose to serve.
436
00:39:26,490 to 00:39:30,201
If the senate votes to create an army,
it's sure to push us into a civil war.
437
00:39:30,285 to 00:39:32,119
It's unthinkable!
438
00:39:32,204 to 00:39:35,623
There hasn't been a full-scale war
since the formation of the Republic.
439
00:39:35,707 to 00:39:38,209
Do you see any way through negotiations...
440
00:39:38,293 to 00:39:40,419
to bring the separatists
back into the Republic?
441
00:39:40,504 to 00:39:42,713
Not if they feel threatened.
442
00:39:42,798 to 00:39:46,217
They'll turn to the Trade Federations
or the Commerce Guilds for help.
443
00:39:46,301 to 00:39:48,261
It's outrageous...
444
00:39:48,345 to 00:39:50,680
but after four trials
in the Supreme Court...
445
00:39:50,764 to 00:39:54,558
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy
of the Trade Federation.
446
00:39:54,643 to 00:39:58,688
I fear the senate is powerless
to resolve this crisis.
447
00:40:00,816 to 00:40:02,984
We must keep our faith in the Republic.
448
00:40:09,825 to 00:40:13,911
The day we stop believing democracy
can work is the day we lose it.
449
00:40:13,996 to 00:40:16,747
Let's pray that day never comes.
450
00:40:16,832 to 00:40:19,500
In the meantime,
we must consider your own safety.
451
00:40:20,335 to 00:40:22,586
What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?
452
00:40:22,671 to 00:40:26,090
Anakin's not a Jedi yet.
He's still a Padawan learner.
453
00:40:26,174 to 00:40:28,050
But I was thinking...
Hold on a minute.
454
00:40:28,135 to 00:40:29,427
Excuse me.
455
00:40:29,511 to 00:40:31,929
I was thinking I would stay
in the lake country.
456
00:40:32,014 to 00:40:34,140
There are some places up there
that are very isolated.
457
00:40:34,224 to 00:40:37,476
Excuse me. I'm in charge
of security here, milady.
458
00:40:38,186 to 00:40:41,188
And this is my home. I know it very well.
That is why we're here.
459
00:40:41,273 to 00:40:43,274
I think it would be wise...
460
00:40:43,358 to 00:40:45,818
if you took advantage
of my knowledge in this instance.
461
00:40:47,154 to 00:40:49,071
Sorry, milady.
462
00:40:52,159 to 00:40:54,410
Perfect. It's settled, then.
463
00:41:08,383 to 00:41:11,135
There it is, R4, right where it should be.
464
00:41:11,219 to 00:41:13,054
Our missing planet Kamino.
465
00:41:51,218 to 00:41:53,094
Master Jedi.
466
00:41:54,054 to 00:41:56,597
The prime minister is expecting you.
467
00:41:57,724 to 00:42:00,226
I'm expected?
Of course.
468
00:42:01,103 to 00:42:03,354
He is anxious to meet you.
469
00:42:03,438 to 00:42:05,648
After all these years...
470
00:42:05,732 to 00:42:09,360
we were beginning to think
you weren't coming.
471
00:42:09,444 to 00:42:11,737
Now, please, this way.
472
00:42:24,376 to 00:42:27,002
May I present Lama Su...
473
00:42:27,087 to 00:42:29,130
prime minister of Kamino.
474
00:42:30,841 to 00:42:33,050
And this is Master Jedi...
475
00:42:33,135 to 00:42:35,052
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
476
00:42:35,137 to 00:42:38,472
I trust you're going to enjoy your stay.
477
00:42:39,850 to 00:42:41,934
Please.
478
00:42:43,520 to 00:42:45,729
And now to business.
479
00:42:45,814 to 00:42:49,817
You will be delighted to hear
that we are on schedule.
480
00:42:50,861 to 00:42:52,778
200,000 units are ready...
481
00:42:52,863 to 00:42:55,281
with a million more well on the way.
482
00:42:56,324 to 00:42:58,325
That's good news.
483
00:42:58,410 to 00:43:01,579
Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas...
484
00:43:01,663 to 00:43:05,040
that his order will be met on time.
485
00:43:05,125 to 00:43:07,168
I'm sorry. Master...
486
00:43:08,295 to 00:43:10,880
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still...
487
00:43:10,964 to 00:43:14,091
a leading member of the Jedi Council,
is he not?
488
00:43:14,176 to 00:43:18,012
Master Sifo-Dyas was killed
almost ten years ago.
489
00:43:19,639 to 00:43:21,974
I'm so sorry to hear that.
490
00:43:22,058 to 00:43:26,353
But I'm sure he would have been proud
of the army we've built for him.
491
00:43:26,438 to 00:43:28,814
The army?
492
00:43:28,899 to 00:43:32,610
Yes, a clone army, and I must say...
493
00:43:32,694 to 00:43:34,904
one of the finest we've ever created.
494
00:43:34,988 to 00:43:36,989
Tell me, Prime Minister...
495
00:43:37,073 to 00:43:39,617
when my master first contacted you
about the army...
496
00:43:39,701 to 00:43:41,827
did he say who it was for?
497
00:43:41,912 to 00:43:43,954
Of course he did.
498
00:43:44,039 to 00:43:46,749
This army is for the Republic.
499
00:43:47,584 to 00:43:51,212
But you must be anxious
to inspect the units for yourself.
500
00:43:52,756 to 00:43:54,882
That's why I'm here.
501
00:44:15,570 to 00:44:17,863
We used to come here for school retreat.
502
00:44:19,574 to 00:44:21,700
We would swim to that island every day.
503
00:44:22,953 to 00:44:24,954
I love the water.
504
00:44:29,584 to 00:44:33,712
We used to lie out on the sand
and let the sun dry us...
505
00:44:33,797 to 00:44:36,799
and try to guess the names
of the birds singing.
506
00:44:39,636 to 00:44:41,720
I don't like sand.
507
00:44:42,389 to 00:44:46,392
It's coarse and rough and irritating...
508
00:44:46,476 to 00:44:48,561
and it gets everywhere.
509
00:44:50,605 to 00:44:52,773
Not like here.
510
00:44:53,400 to 00:44:55,401
Here, everything is soft...
511
00:44:57,404 to 00:44:59,738
and smooth.
512
00:45:36,276 to 00:45:37,985
No.
513
00:45:38,612 to 00:45:40,654
I shouldn't have done that.
514
00:45:42,365 to 00:45:44,366
I'm sorry.
515
00:45:57,964 to 00:45:59,590
Very impressive.
516
00:45:59,674 to 00:46:01,842
I'd hoped you would be pleased.
517
00:46:04,971 to 00:46:07,473
Clones can think creatively.
518
00:46:07,557 to 00:46:11,518
You will find that they are
immensely superior to droids.
519
00:46:15,231 to 00:46:20,653
We take great pride in our combat
education and training programs.
520
00:46:20,737 to 00:46:24,114
This group was created
about five years ago.
521
00:46:24,199 to 00:46:26,283
You mentioned growth acceleration.
522
00:46:26,368 to 00:46:28,327
Oh, yes, it's essential.
523
00:46:28,411 to 00:46:31,455
Otherwise, a mature clone
would take a lifetime to grow.
524
00:46:31,539 to 00:46:34,166
Now we can do it in half the time.
525
00:46:34,250 to 00:46:36,960
I see.
526
00:46:37,045 to 00:46:38,962
They are totally obedient...
527
00:46:39,047 to 00:46:41,757
taking any order without question.
528
00:46:41,841 to 00:46:43,926
We modified their genetic structure...
529
00:46:44,010 to 00:46:47,221
to make them less independent
than the original host.
530
00:46:47,305 to 00:46:49,807
And who was the original host?
531
00:46:49,891 to 00:46:52,101
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.
532
00:46:53,561 to 00:46:55,688
And where is this bounty hunter now?
533
00:46:55,772 to 00:46:58,065
Oh, we keep him here.
534
00:47:00,485 to 00:47:03,529
Apart from his pay, which
is considerable...
535
00:47:03,613 to 00:47:06,156
Fett demanded only one thing:
536
00:47:06,241 to 00:47:08,826
an unaltered clone for himself.
537
00:47:08,910 to 00:47:11,370
Curious, isn't it?
"Unaltered"?
538
00:47:11,454 to 00:47:13,997
Pure genetic replication.
539
00:47:14,082 to 00:47:17,292
No tampering with the structure
to make it more docile...
540
00:47:17,377 to 00:47:19,920
and no growth acceleration.
541
00:47:20,004 to 00:47:23,340
I should very much like
to meet this Jango Fett.
542
00:47:23,425 to 00:47:26,719
I would be very happy
to arrange it for you.
543
00:47:44,237 to 00:47:47,114
Magnificent, aren't they?
544
00:47:53,163 to 00:47:55,080
I don't know.
545
00:47:56,124 to 00:47:58,417
Sure you do.
You just don't want to tell me.
546
00:47:58,501 to 00:48:00,878
You gonna use one of your
Jedi mind tricks on me?
547
00:48:00,962 to 00:48:03,130
They only work on the weak-minded.
548
00:48:04,466 to 00:48:06,175
All right.
549
00:48:06,259 to 00:48:08,427
I was 12. His name was Palo.
550
00:48:08,511 to 00:48:11,054
We were both in the
Legislative Youth Program.
551
00:48:11,139 to 00:48:14,099
He was a few years older than I. Very cute.
552
00:48:14,184 to 00:48:16,685
Dark, curly hair. Dreamy eyes.
553
00:48:16,770 to 00:48:19,062
All right, I get the picture.
554
00:48:19,147 to 00:48:21,064
Whatever happened to him?
555
00:48:21,149 to 00:48:23,901
I went into public service.
He went on to become an artist.
556
00:48:23,985 to 00:48:26,069
Maybe he was the smart one.
557
00:48:26,154 to 00:48:28,405
You really don't like politicians, do you?
558
00:48:28,490 to 00:48:30,699
I like two or three...
559
00:48:30,784 to 00:48:32,868
but I'm not really sure about one of them.
560
00:48:36,706 to 00:48:39,082
I don't think the system works.
561
00:48:39,167 to 00:48:41,794
How would you have it work?
562
00:48:42,295 to 00:48:46,423
We need a system where the politicians
sit down and discuss the problem...
563
00:48:46,508 to 00:48:49,092
agree what's in the best interest
of all the people...
564
00:48:49,177 to 00:48:50,928
and then do it.
565
00:48:51,012 to 00:48:52,930
That's exactly what we do.
566
00:48:53,014 to 00:48:55,015
The trouble is that people
don't always agree.
567
00:48:55,099 to 00:48:57,017
Well, then they should be made to.
568
00:48:57,101 to 00:49:00,229
By whom? Who's gonna make them?
I don't know. Someone.
569
00:49:00,313 to 00:49:02,397
You?
Of course not me.
570
00:49:02,482 to 00:49:05,442
But someone.
Someone wise.
571
00:49:05,527 to 00:49:09,363
Sounds an awful lot like
a dictatorship to me.
572
00:49:10,698 to 00:49:13,158
Well, if it works.
573
00:49:20,208 to 00:49:22,000
You're making fun of me.
No.
574
00:49:22,085 to 00:49:24,711
I'd be much too frightened
to tease a senator.
575
00:50:03,710 to 00:50:06,253
Ani, are you all right?
576
00:50:42,707 to 00:50:45,626
Boba, is your father here?
577
00:50:46,628 to 00:50:47,669
Yep.
578
00:50:47,754 to 00:50:49,838
May we see him?
579
00:50:50,465 to 00:50:52,799
Sure.
580
00:50:54,302 to 00:50:56,511
Dad, Taun We's here.
581
00:51:09,651 to 00:51:12,402
Jango, welcome back.
582
00:51:12,487 to 00:51:14,404
Was your trip productive?
583
00:51:14,489 to 00:51:16,448
Fairly.
584
00:51:16,532 to 00:51:20,410
This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.
585
00:51:20,495 to 00:51:23,538
He's come to check on our progress.
586
00:51:23,623 to 00:51:26,500
Your clones are very impressive.
You must be very proud.
587
00:51:26,584 to 00:51:29,628
I'm just a simple man trying
to make my way in the universe.
588
00:51:29,712 to 00:51:33,465
Ever made your way as far
into the interior as Coruscant?
589
00:51:34,258 to 00:51:36,468
Once or twice.
Recently?
590
00:51:38,429 to 00:51:40,097
Possibly.
591
00:51:40,181 to 00:51:42,516
Then you must know Master Sifo-Dyas.
592
00:51:46,980 to 00:51:49,147
Boba, rood eht so-heeck.
593
00:51:50,316 to 00:51:51,733
Master who?
594
00:51:53,736 to 00:51:55,779
Sifo-Dyas.
595
00:51:55,863 to 00:51:58,532
Is he not the Jedi who
hired you for this job?
596
00:52:01,494 to 00:52:03,370
Never heard of him.
597
00:52:06,249 to 00:52:07,374
Really?
598
00:52:08,376 to 00:52:12,462
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus
on one of the moons of Bogden.
599
00:52:12,547 to 00:52:14,214
Curious.
600
00:52:18,219 to 00:52:20,512
Do you like your army?
601
00:52:21,264 to 00:52:23,265
I look forward to seeing them in action.
602
00:52:24,517 to 00:52:27,894
They'll do their job well.
I'll guarantee that.
603
00:52:27,979 to 00:52:30,188
Thank you for your time, Jango.
604
00:52:31,899 to 00:52:34,067
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.
605
00:52:53,254 to 00:52:55,714
What is it, Dad?
606
00:52:56,883 to 00:52:59,092
Pack your things. We're leaving.
607
00:53:03,765 to 00:53:08,310
And when I got to them,
we went into aggressive negotiations.
608
00:53:08,394 to 00:53:10,437
"Aggressive negotiations"? What's that?
609
00:53:10,521 to 00:53:14,066
Well, negotiations with a lightsaber.
610
00:53:26,996 to 00:53:30,165
If Master Obi-Wan caught me
doing this, he'd be very grumpy.
611
00:53:59,487 to 00:54:01,780
From the moment I met you...
612
00:54:02,824 to 00:54:05,367
all those years ago...
613
00:54:05,451 to 00:54:08,495
not a day has gone by
when I haven't thought of you.
614
00:54:11,165 to 00:54:13,625
And now that I'm with you again...
615
00:54:14,210 to 00:54:16,336
I'm in agony.
616
00:54:19,632 to 00:54:23,593
The closer I get to you, the worse it gets.
617
00:54:23,678 to 00:54:26,179
The thought of not being with you...
618
00:54:27,014 to 00:54:28,974
I can't breathe.
619
00:54:32,812 to 00:54:34,729
I'm haunted by the kiss...
620
00:54:34,814 to 00:54:38,150
that you should never have given me.
621
00:54:38,234 to 00:54:40,610
My heart is beating...
622
00:54:40,695 to 00:54:43,655
hoping that that kiss
will not become a scar.
623
00:54:45,783 to 00:54:48,743
You are in my very soul...
624
00:54:48,828 to 00:54:50,871
tormenting me.
625
00:54:53,332 to 00:54:56,877
What can I do?
I will do anything that you ask.
626
00:55:07,763 to 00:55:11,391
If you are suffering
as much as I am, please, tell me.
627
00:55:13,227 to 00:55:15,187
I can't.
628
00:55:16,063 to 00:55:19,316
We can't. It's... just not possible.
629
00:55:19,400 to 00:55:22,402
Anything is possible, Padmé. Listen to me.
630
00:55:22,486 to 00:55:24,571
No, you listen.
631
00:55:25,072 to 00:55:28,825
We live in a real world. Come back to it.
632
00:55:28,910 to 00:55:32,579
You're studying to become a Jedi.
I'm a senator.
633
00:55:34,457 to 00:55:36,958
If you follow your thoughts
through to conclusion...
634
00:55:37,043 to 00:55:39,586
it'll take us to a place we cannot go...
635
00:55:40,713 to 00:55:43,048
regardless of the way
we feel about each other.
636
00:55:43,132 to 00:55:45,175
Then you do feel something.
637
00:55:45,259 to 00:55:48,345
I will not let you give
up your future for me.
638
00:55:48,429 to 00:55:50,597
You are asking me to be rational.
639
00:55:51,557 to 00:55:53,975
That is something I know I cannot do.
640
00:55:54,060 to 00:55:58,730
Believe me, I wish that
I could just wish away my feelings...
641
00:55:58,814 to 00:56:00,899
but I can't.
642
00:56:01,776 to 00:56:04,569
I will not give in to this.
643
00:56:11,619 to 00:56:13,870
Well, you know...
644
00:56:13,955 to 00:56:16,790
it wouldn't have to be that way.
645
00:56:16,874 to 00:56:19,793
We could keep it a secret.
646
00:56:21,170 to 00:56:23,213
We'd be living a lie...
647
00:56:23,297 to 00:56:25,632
one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to.
648
00:56:26,676 to 00:56:29,010
I couldn't do that.
649
00:56:29,095 to 00:56:31,972
Could you, Anakin?
Could you live like that?
650
00:56:33,933 to 00:56:36,977
No. You're right.
651
00:56:38,437 to 00:56:40,438
It would destroy us.
652
00:56:47,863 to 00:56:52,075
Tell your council that
the first battalions are ready.
653
00:56:52,159 to 00:56:55,287
And remind them, if they
need more troops...
654
00:56:55,371 to 00:56:58,540
it will take more time to grow them.
655
00:56:58,624 to 00:57:00,417
I won't forget, and thank you.
656
00:57:00,501 to 00:57:02,377
Thank you.
657
00:57:18,644 to 00:57:20,770
R4!
658
00:57:20,855 to 00:57:24,190
Scramble code five to Coruscant,
care of the old folks' home!
659
00:57:30,656 to 00:57:34,075
I have successfully made contact
with the prime minister of Kamino.
660
00:57:34,160 to 00:57:38,079
They are using a bounty hunter named
Jango Fett to create a clone army.
661
00:57:38,164 to 00:57:40,665
I have a strong feeling
that this bounty hunter...
662
00:57:40,750 to 00:57:42,876
is the assassin we are looking for.
663
00:57:42,960 to 00:57:44,961
Do you think these cloners are involved...
664
00:57:45,046 to 00:57:47,130
in the plot to assassinate Senator Amidala?
665
00:57:47,214 to 00:57:50,133
No, Master. There appears to be no motive.
666
00:57:50,217 to 00:57:53,136
Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan.
667
00:57:53,220 to 00:57:56,264
Clear your mind must be...
668
00:57:56,349 to 00:58:00,518
if you are to discover
the real villains behind this plot.
669
00:58:00,603 to 00:58:02,479
Yes, Master.
670
00:58:02,563 to 00:58:05,648
They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed
an order for a clone army...
671
00:58:05,733 to 00:58:09,402
at the request of the senate
almost ten years ago.
672
00:58:12,114 to 00:58:15,075
I was under the impression
he was killed before that.
673
00:58:15,159 to 00:58:18,703
Did the council ever authorize
the creation of a clone army?
674
00:58:18,788 to 00:58:20,705
No. Whoever placed that order...
675
00:58:20,790 to 00:58:23,083
did not have the authorization
of the Jedi Council.
676
00:58:23,167 to 00:58:26,878
Bring him here. Question him we will.
677
00:58:28,130 to 00:58:31,091
Yes, Master.
I will report back when I have him.
678
00:58:32,593 to 00:58:38,598
Blind we are if creation of this clone army
we could not see.
679
00:58:41,936 to 00:58:44,145
I think it is time we
informed the senate...
680
00:58:44,230 to 00:58:46,272
that our ability to use
the Force has diminished.
681
00:58:47,108 to 00:58:51,528
Only the dark lord of the Sith
knows of our weakness.
682
00:58:51,612 to 00:58:53,863
If informed the senate is...
683
00:58:53,948 to 00:58:56,449
multiply our adversaries will.
684
00:58:58,077 to 00:58:59,744
No.
685
00:59:01,122 to 00:59:03,039
Anakin! Help me!
686
00:59:03,124 to 00:59:05,500
Mom, no.
Anakin!
687
00:59:33,696 to 00:59:35,989
Don't go.
688
00:59:37,992 to 00:59:39,993
I don't want to disturb you.
689
00:59:41,162 to 00:59:43,288
Your presence is soothing.
690
00:59:46,000 to 00:59:48,293
You had another nightmare last night.
691
00:59:49,462 to 00:59:51,838
Jedi don't have nightmares.
692
00:59:52,339 to 00:59:54,382
I heard you.
693
00:59:59,305 to 01:00:01,347
I saw my mother.
694
01:00:04,310 to 01:00:06,394
She is suffering, Padmé.
695
01:00:08,814 to 01:00:12,066
I saw her as clearly as I see you now.
696
01:00:23,329 to 01:00:25,914
She is in pain.
697
01:00:26,957 to 01:00:30,376
I know I'm disobeying my mandate
to protect you, Senator...
698
01:00:30,461 to 01:00:32,504
but I have to go.
699
01:00:35,382 to 01:00:37,467
I have to help her.
700
01:00:39,136 to 01:00:41,095
I'll go with you.
701
01:00:41,180 to 01:00:43,473
I'm sorry. I don't have a choice.
702
01:00:54,527 to 01:00:56,361
Dad, look!
703
01:00:57,029 to 01:00:59,531
Boba, get on board!
704
01:02:15,733 to 01:02:17,483
Oh, not good.
705
01:04:26,989 to 01:04:28,489
Wait right there.
706
01:04:28,574 to 01:04:30,616
Okey-okey.
707
01:04:33,537 to 01:04:34,662
Chut-chut, Watto.
708
01:04:36,707 to 01:04:38,958
Let me help you with that.
709
01:04:39,960 to 01:04:43,379
What? What do you want?
710
01:04:43,464 to 01:04:45,965
Wait! You're a Jedi!
711
01:04:46,967 to 01:04:49,302
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
712
01:04:54,808 to 01:04:57,143
I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.
713
01:04:59,897 to 01:05:01,564
Ani?
714
01:05:03,442 to 01:05:05,276
Little Ani?
715
01:05:08,155 to 01:05:10,156
Nahhh.
716
01:05:11,909 to 01:05:14,660
You are Ani! It is you!
717
01:05:16,038 to 01:05:19,332
You sure sprouted, huh?
718
01:05:20,125 to 01:05:22,668
A Jedi! Whattaya know!
719
01:05:25,923 to 01:05:29,842
Maybe you could help with some
deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.
720
01:05:29,927 to 01:05:31,427
My mother.
721
01:05:31,512 to 01:05:34,013
Oh, yeah. Shmi.
722
01:05:35,474 to 01:05:38,726
She's not mine-a no more-a. I sold her.
723
01:05:38,811 to 01:05:41,145
You sold her?
Years ago.
724
01:05:41,230 to 01:05:44,357
Sorry, Ani, but you know,
business is business.
725
01:05:45,442 to 01:05:49,237
I sold her to a moisture farmer named Lars.
726
01:05:49,321 to 01:05:51,364
At least I think it was Lars.
727
01:05:51,448 to 01:05:54,992
Believe it or not, I heard
he freed her and married her!
728
01:05:55,077 to 01:05:57,370
Can ya beat that, eh?
729
01:05:59,873 to 01:06:01,999
Do you know where they are now?
730
01:06:02,918 to 01:06:04,961
Long way from here.
731
01:06:05,045 to 01:06:09,549
Someplace over on the other side
of Mos Eisley, I think.
732
01:06:09,633 to 01:06:11,717
I'd like to know.
733
01:06:13,303 to 01:06:16,097
Sure. Absolutely!
734
01:06:17,140 to 01:06:19,225
Let's go look at my records, huh?
735
01:06:47,588 to 01:06:50,673
Dad! I think we're being tracked!
736
01:06:50,757 to 01:06:54,218
He must have put a homing
device on our hull.
737
01:06:54,303 to 01:06:56,596
Hang on, son.
We'll move into the asteroid field...
738
01:06:56,680 to 01:06:59,557
and we'll have a couple
of surprises for him.
739
01:07:10,527 to 01:07:12,528
Seismic charges!
740
01:07:12,613 to 01:07:13,988
Stand by.
741
01:07:39,264 to 01:07:41,974
He doesn't seem to take a hint, this guy.
742
01:08:00,410 to 01:08:01,827
Watch out!
743
01:08:21,515 to 01:08:24,350
Get him, Dad! Fire!
744
01:08:26,186 to 01:08:28,813
Blast! This is why I hate flying!
745
01:08:48,792 to 01:08:50,334
We got him!
746
01:08:50,419 to 01:08:52,503
We'll just have to finish him.
747
01:09:18,363 to 01:09:21,949
R4, prepare to jettison
the spare part canisters.
748
01:09:25,912 to 01:09:27,830
Fire them now!
749
01:09:40,844 to 01:09:43,387
We won't be seeing him again.
750
01:10:17,839 to 01:10:19,924
Well, R4, I think we've waited long enough.
751
01:10:40,487 to 01:10:44,448
There's an unusual concentration
of Federation ships over there, R4.
752
01:11:20,527 to 01:11:22,486
Stay with the ship, R2.
753
01:11:37,085 to 01:11:41,005
Hello. How might I be of service? I am C...
754
01:11:41,089 to 01:11:43,007
3PO?
755
01:11:44,843 to 01:11:46,719
The maker!
756
01:11:46,803 to 01:11:48,470
Master Ani!
757
01:11:48,555 to 01:11:51,390
I knew you would return. I knew it!
758
01:11:51,474 to 01:11:53,225
And Miss Padmé. Oh, my.
759
01:11:53,310 to 01:11:54,935
Hello, 3PO.
760
01:11:55,020 to 01:11:58,939
Bless my circuits!
I'm so pleased to see you both.
761
01:11:59,024 to 01:12:01,066
I've come to see my mother.
762
01:12:02,819 to 01:12:04,904
I think perhaps we'd better go indoors.
763
01:12:07,824 to 01:12:12,369
Master Owen, might I present
two most important visitors.
764
01:12:12,454 to 01:12:14,788
I'm Anakin Skywalker.
765
01:12:15,999 to 01:12:17,666
Owen Lars.
766
01:12:17,751 to 01:12:19,960
This is my girlfriend, Beru.
Hello.
767
01:12:20,045 to 01:12:22,338
I'm Padmé.
768
01:12:22,422 to 01:12:24,840
I guess I'm your stepbrother.
769
01:12:24,925 to 01:12:27,843
I had a feeling you might show up someday.
770
01:12:28,929 to 01:12:30,387
Is my mother here?
771
01:12:30,472 to 01:12:32,223
No, she's not.
772
01:12:33,225 to 01:12:35,100
Cliegg Lars.
773
01:12:35,185 to 01:12:37,269
Shmi is my wife.
774
01:12:38,104 to 01:12:41,357
We should go inside.
We have a lot to talk about.
775
01:12:48,865 to 01:12:52,034
It was just before dawn.
They came out of nowhere.
776
01:12:52,118 to 01:12:55,079
A hunting party of Tusken Raiders.
777
01:12:56,039 to 01:12:58,958
Your mother had gone out early,
like she always did...
778
01:12:59,042 to 01:13:02,461
to pick mushrooms that
grow on the vaporators.
779
01:13:03,129 to 01:13:06,715
From the tracks, she was
about halfway home...
780
01:13:06,800 to 01:13:08,759
when they took her.
781
01:13:10,303 to 01:13:12,388
Those Tuskens walk like men...
782
01:13:12,472 to 01:13:17,142
but they're vicious, mindless monsters.
783
01:13:18,812 to 01:13:21,981
Thirty of us went out after her.
Four of us came back.
784
01:13:22,899 to 01:13:27,069
I'd be out there with them,
but after I lost my leg...
785
01:13:27,153 to 01:13:32,825
I just couldn't ride anymore until I heal.
786
01:13:33,368 to 01:13:35,661
I don't want to give up on her...
787
01:13:35,745 to 01:13:38,622
but she's been gone a month.
788
01:13:38,707 to 01:13:41,750
There's little hope she's lasted this long.
789
01:13:46,381 to 01:13:48,882
Where are you going?
790
01:13:48,967 to 01:13:51,010
To find my mother.
791
01:13:52,178 to 01:13:55,097
Your mother's dead, son. Accept it.
792
01:14:17,203 to 01:14:20,247
You're gonna have to stay here.
793
01:14:20,332 to 01:14:23,042
These are good people, Padmé.
You'll be safe.
794
01:14:35,555 to 01:14:37,639
I won't be long.
795
01:16:26,583 to 01:16:28,584
We must persuade the Commerce Guild...
796
01:16:28,668 to 01:16:31,128
and the Corporate Alliance
to sign the treaty.
797
01:16:31,212 to 01:16:34,006
What about the senator from Naboo?
798
01:16:34,632 to 01:16:36,675
Is she dead yet?
799
01:16:37,343 to 01:16:41,346
I am not signing your treaty
until I have her head on my desk.
800
01:16:41,431 to 01:16:43,765
I am a man of my word, Viceroy.
801
01:16:43,850 to 01:16:46,935
With these new battle droids
we've built for you...
802
01:16:47,020 to 01:16:50,189
you'll have the finest army in the galaxy.
803
01:17:01,117 to 01:17:03,035
As I explained to you earlier...
804
01:17:03,119 to 01:17:06,371
I am quite convinced
that 10,000 more systems...
805
01:17:06,456 to 01:17:09,333
will rally to our cause
with your support, gentlemen.
806
01:17:10,210 to 01:17:13,212
What you are proposing
could be construed as treason.
807
01:17:13,963 to 01:17:15,839
The Techno Union army...
808
01:17:19,052 to 01:17:21,887
is at your disposal, Count.
809
01:17:22,680 to 01:17:26,225
The Banking Clan will sign your treaty.
810
01:17:26,309 to 01:17:28,227
Good. Very good.
811
01:17:29,312 to 01:17:32,981
Our friends from the Trade Federation
have pledged their support...
812
01:17:33,066 to 01:17:35,734
and when their battle droids
are combined with yours...
813
01:17:35,818 to 01:17:38,904
we shall have an army
greater than any in the galaxy.
814
01:17:39,697 to 01:17:42,407
The Jedi will be overwhelmed.
815
01:17:43,493 to 01:17:47,329
The Republic will agree
to any demands we make.
816
01:18:48,141 to 01:18:50,142
Mom?
817
01:18:52,437 to 01:18:54,563
Ani?
818
01:18:55,773 to 01:18:57,608
Ani?
819
01:18:58,818 to 01:19:00,485
Is it you?
820
01:19:00,570 to 01:19:04,156
I'm here, Mom. You're safe.
821
01:19:10,496 to 01:19:13,540
You look so handsome.
822
01:19:16,919 to 01:19:19,046
My son.
823
01:19:19,130 to 01:19:21,923
My grown-up son.
824
01:19:23,426 to 01:19:25,719
I'm so proud of you, Ani.
825
01:19:25,803 to 01:19:27,763
I missed you.
826
01:19:30,475 to 01:19:32,643
Now I am complete.
827
01:19:38,608 to 01:19:41,693
I love y...
828
01:19:42,820 to 01:19:45,947
Stay with me, Mom. Everything...
829
01:19:46,032 to 01:19:48,200
I love...
830
01:19:49,661 to 01:19:52,162
I love...
831
01:20:49,345 to 01:20:51,263
Anakin!
832
01:20:51,764 to 01:20:53,265
No!
833
01:21:13,786 to 01:21:15,328
What is it?
834
01:21:16,372 to 01:21:19,875
Pain, suffering...
835
01:21:20,418 to 01:21:22,461
death I feel.
836
01:21:26,966 to 01:21:30,135
Something terrible has happened.
837
01:21:32,764 to 01:21:35,807
Young Skywalker is in pain...
838
01:21:35,892 to 01:21:37,809
terrible pain.
839
01:21:42,565 to 01:21:46,234
The transmitter is working,
but we're not receiving a return signal.
840
01:21:46,319 to 01:21:49,112
Coruscant's too far.
R4, can you boost the power?
841
01:21:50,615 to 01:21:52,657
We'll have to try something else.
842
01:21:55,495 to 01:21:58,580
Maybe we can contact Anakin on Naboo.
843
01:21:58,664 to 01:22:00,332
It's much closer.
844
01:22:02,126 to 01:22:04,503
Anakin, do you copy?
845
01:22:04,587 to 01:22:07,589
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin?
846
01:22:07,673 to 01:22:10,008
He's not on Naboo, R4.
847
01:22:11,552 to 01:22:13,762
I'm going to try and widen the range.
848
01:22:17,141 to 01:22:19,184
I do hope nothing's happened to him.
849
01:22:26,609 to 01:22:28,527
That's Anakin's tracking
signal, all right...
850
01:22:28,611 to 01:22:31,112
but it's coming from Tatooine.
851
01:22:32,657 to 01:22:35,283
What in the blazes is he doing there?
852
01:22:35,368 to 01:22:37,369
I told him to stay on Naboo.
853
01:22:40,832 to 01:22:42,541
We haven't got much time.
854
01:22:42,625 to 01:22:44,709
Anakin, do you copy?
855
01:22:44,794 to 01:22:46,878
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.
856
01:22:54,762 to 01:22:56,721
Retransmit this message...
857
01:22:58,724 to 01:23:01,434
Anakin, do you copy?
858
01:23:01,519 to 01:23:03,895
My long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.
859
01:23:03,980 to 01:23:06,398
Retransmit this message to Coruscant.
860
01:23:50,776 to 01:23:52,903
I brought you something.
861
01:23:52,987 to 01:23:55,113
Are you hungry?
862
01:23:56,782 to 01:23:58,867
The shifter broke.
863
01:24:00,703 to 01:24:03,538
Life seems so much simpler
when you're fixing things.
864
01:24:05,958 to 01:24:09,461
I'm good at fixing things. Always was.
865
01:24:11,797 to 01:24:13,798
But I couldn't...
866
01:24:17,637 to 01:24:19,721
Why'd she have to die?
867
01:24:23,142 to 01:24:25,310
Why couldn't I save her?
868
01:24:25,394 to 01:24:27,479
I know I could have!
869
01:24:30,149 to 01:24:32,817
Sometimes there are things no one can fix.
870
01:24:34,487 to 01:24:37,155
You're not all-powerful, Ani.
Well, I should be!
871
01:24:39,909 to 01:24:42,160
Someday I will be.
872
01:24:42,244 to 01:24:44,913
I will be the most powerful Jedi ever.
873
01:24:46,582 to 01:24:48,667
I promise you.
874
01:24:49,335 to 01:24:51,795
I will even learn to
stop people from dying.
875
01:24:55,383 to 01:24:59,511
It's all Obi-Wan's fault! He's jealous!
876
01:24:59,595 to 01:25:01,680
He's holding me back!
877
01:25:05,851 to 01:25:08,103
What's wrong, Ani?
878
01:25:18,656 to 01:25:20,824
I killed them.
879
01:25:22,368 to 01:25:24,536
I killed them all.
880
01:25:26,163 to 01:25:28,248
They're dead.
881
01:25:28,332 to 01:25:30,458
Every single one of them.
882
01:25:32,503 to 01:25:34,546
And not just the men...
883
01:25:36,465 to 01:25:38,550
but the women...
884
01:25:38,634 to 01:25:40,593
and the children too.
885
01:25:41,512 to 01:25:43,596
They're like animals...
886
01:25:43,681 to 01:25:46,057
and I slaughtered them like animals!
887
01:25:47,643 to 01:25:49,686
I hate them!
888
01:26:07,371 to 01:26:09,497
To be angry is to be human.
889
01:26:09,582 to 01:26:11,499
I'm a Jedi.
890
01:26:12,460 to 01:26:14,502
I know I'm better than this.
891
01:26:28,309 to 01:26:33,021
I know wherever you are
it's become a better place.
892
01:26:33,105 to 01:26:38,276
You were the most loving partner
a man could ever have.
893
01:26:41,113 to 01:26:43,281
Good-bye, my darling wife.
894
01:26:47,244 to 01:26:49,245
And thank you.
895
01:27:16,357 to 01:27:18,775
I wasn't strong enough to save you, Mom.
896
01:27:21,237 to 01:27:23,154
I wasn't strong enough.
897
01:27:27,660 to 01:27:31,079
But I promise I won't fail again.
898
01:27:41,882 to 01:27:44,092
I miss you...
899
01:27:45,427 to 01:27:47,387
so much.
900
01:27:54,311 to 01:27:57,021
R2? What are you doing here?
901
01:27:59,775 to 01:28:04,195
It seems that he is carrying
a message from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.
902
01:28:04,989 to 01:28:08,283
Master Ani, does that name
mean anything to you?
903
01:28:10,369 to 01:28:12,871
Anakin, my long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.
904
01:28:12,955 to 01:28:15,248
Retransmit this message to Coruscant.
905
01:28:19,712 to 01:28:21,963
I have tracked the bounty hunter,
Jango Fett...
906
01:28:22,047 to 01:28:24,215
to the droid foundries on Geonosis.
907
01:28:24,300 to 01:28:27,969
The Trade Federation is
to take delivery of a droid army here...
908
01:28:28,053 to 01:28:30,096
and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray...
909
01:28:30,181 to 01:28:33,683
is behind the assassination attempts
on Senator Amidala.
910
01:28:33,767 to 01:28:35,935
The Commerce Guilds
and the Corporate Alliance...
911
01:28:36,020 to 01:28:39,731
have both pledged their armies
to Count Dooku and are forming...
912
01:28:39,815 to 01:28:41,900
Wait.
913
01:28:52,703 to 01:28:57,373
More happening on Geonosis, I feel,
than has been revealed.
914
01:28:57,458 to 01:28:59,250
I agree.
915
01:29:00,628 to 01:29:02,921
We will deal with Count Dooku.
916
01:29:03,005 to 01:29:06,591
The most important thing for you
is to stay where you are.
917
01:29:06,675 to 01:29:09,427
Protect the senator at all costs.
918
01:29:09,511 to 01:29:12,096
That is your first priority.
919
01:29:13,474 to 01:29:15,475
Understood, Master.
920
01:29:15,559 to 01:29:17,518
They'll never get there
in time to save him.
921
01:29:17,603 to 01:29:20,897
They have to come halfway
across the galaxy. Look.
922
01:29:23,025 to 01:29:25,151
Geonosis is less than a parsec away.
923
01:29:25,236 to 01:29:27,237
If he's still alive.
924
01:29:29,114 to 01:29:31,783
Are you just gonna sit
here and let him die?
925
01:29:31,867 to 01:29:34,452
He's your friend, your mentor.
He's like my father!
926
01:29:35,579 to 01:29:39,290
But you heard Master Windu.
He gave me strict orders to stay here.
927
01:29:39,375 to 01:29:42,627
He gave you strict orders to protect me...
928
01:29:42,711 to 01:29:44,963
and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.
929
01:29:46,298 to 01:29:49,884
If you plan to protect me,
you'll just have to come along.
930
01:29:53,764 to 01:29:57,100
I'm not worried, R2.
It's just I've never flown before.
931
01:30:07,319 to 01:30:10,321
The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war.
There can be no doubt of that.
932
01:30:10,406 to 01:30:12,407
Count Dooku must have
made a treaty with them.
933
01:30:12,491 to 01:30:15,910
The debate is over.
934
01:30:15,995 to 01:30:18,997
Now we need that clone army.
935
01:30:19,081 to 01:30:22,041
Unfortunately, the debate is not over.
936
01:30:22,126 to 01:30:24,585
The senate will never approve
the use of clones...
937
01:30:24,670 to 01:30:26,462
before the separatists attack.
938
01:30:26,547 to 01:30:28,423
This is a crisis.
939
01:30:28,507 to 01:30:31,676
The senate must vote the chancellor
emergency powers.
940
01:30:31,760 to 01:30:35,096
He can then approve the
creation of an army.
941
01:30:35,180 to 01:30:37,390
But what senator would have the courage...
942
01:30:37,474 to 01:30:40,059
to propose such a radical amendment?
943
01:30:40,144 to 01:30:44,272
If only Senator Amidala were here.
944
01:31:05,627 to 01:31:07,879
Traitor.
945
01:31:07,963 to 01:31:11,132
Oh, no, my friend.
This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.
946
01:31:11,216 to 01:31:13,343
They have gone too far. This is madness.
947
01:31:13,427 to 01:31:16,054
I thought you were the leader here, Dooku.
948
01:31:16,138 to 01:31:18,765
This had nothing to do
with me, I assure you.
949
01:31:18,849 to 01:31:22,310
I will petition immediately
to have you set free.
950
01:31:22,394 to 01:31:26,064
Well, I hope it doesn't take too long.
I have work to do.
951
01:31:26,148 to 01:31:29,984
May I ask why a Jedi knight...
952
01:31:30,069 to 01:31:32,528
is all the way out here on Geonosis?
953
01:31:32,613 to 01:31:35,490
I've been tracking a bounty hunter
named Jango Fett.
954
01:31:35,574 to 01:31:37,283
Do you know him?
955
01:31:37,368 to 01:31:40,161
There are no bounty hunters here
that I am aware of.
956
01:31:40,245 to 01:31:42,246
The Geonosians don't trust them.
957
01:31:42,331 to 01:31:45,249
Who can blame them?
But he is here, I can assure you.
958
01:31:46,335 to 01:31:50,546
It's a great pity our paths
have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.
959
01:31:51,173 to 01:31:53,674
Qui-Gon always spoke very highly of you.
960
01:31:58,514 to 01:32:00,598
I wish he were still alive.
961
01:32:02,017 to 01:32:04,769
I could use his help right now.
962
01:32:05,604 to 01:32:08,106
Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you.
963
01:32:09,858 to 01:32:12,777
Don't be so sure, my young Jedi.
964
01:32:12,861 to 01:32:15,446
You forget that he was
once my apprentice...
965
01:32:15,531 to 01:32:17,615
just as you were once his.
966
01:32:18,534 to 01:32:20,743
He knew all about the corruption
in the senate...
967
01:32:20,828 to 01:32:23,913
but he wouldn't have gone along with
it if he had learned the truth as I have.
968
01:32:23,997 to 01:32:26,791
The truth?
The truth.
969
01:32:33,132 to 01:32:35,883
What if I told you that the Republic
was now under the control...
970
01:32:35,968 to 01:32:38,219
of the dark lord of the Sith?
971
01:32:38,303 to 01:32:41,639
No, that's not possible.
The Jedi would be aware of it.
972
01:32:41,723 to 01:32:45,977
The dark side of the Force
has clouded their vision, my friend.
973
01:32:47,104 to 01:32:49,689
Hundreds of senators
are now under the influence...
974
01:32:49,773 to 01:32:54,444
of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious.
975
01:32:55,320 to 01:32:57,071
I don't believe you.
976
01:32:57,156 to 01:32:59,574
The viceroy of the Trade Federation...
977
01:32:59,658 to 01:33:02,910
was once in league with
this Darth Sidious...
978
01:33:03,745 to 01:33:07,623
but he was betrayed
ten years ago by the dark lord.
979
01:33:07,708 to 01:33:10,835
He came to me for help.
He told me everything.
980
01:33:12,838 to 01:33:14,922
You must join me, Obi-Wan...
981
01:33:15,924 to 01:33:20,136
and together we will destroy the Sith!
982
01:33:21,680 to 01:33:24,140
I will never join you, Dooku.
983
01:33:33,442 to 01:33:36,527
It may be difficult to secure your release.
984
01:33:44,119 to 01:33:50,041
It's-a clear desa separatists made a pact
wesa desa Federation du Trade.
985
01:33:50,125 to 01:33:54,462
Senators, "dellow felagates":
986
01:33:54,546 to 01:33:58,591
In response to this direct threat
to the Republic...
987
01:33:58,675 to 01:34:02,386
mesa propose that the senate...
988
01:34:02,471 to 01:34:06,140
give immediately emergency powers...
989
01:34:06,225 to 01:34:08,893
to the supreme chancellor.
990
01:34:12,940 to 01:34:15,107
Palpatine! Palpatine!
991
01:34:18,153 to 01:34:21,447
Order! We shall have order!
992
01:34:23,075 to 01:34:26,452
It is with great reluctance...
993
01:34:26,537 to 01:34:28,663
that I have agreed to this calling.
994
01:34:29,831 to 01:34:34,001
I love democracy. I love the Republic.
995
01:34:34,836 to 01:34:37,046
The power you give me...
996
01:34:37,130 to 01:34:41,676
I will lay down when
this crisis has abated.
997
01:34:46,139 to 01:34:50,977
And as my first act with
this new authority...
998
01:34:51,061 to 01:34:55,481
I will create a grand
army of the Republic...
999
01:34:55,566 to 01:34:59,360
to counter the increasing threats
of the separatists.
1000
01:35:00,696 to 01:35:02,613
It is done, then.
1001
01:35:07,786 to 01:35:11,581
I will take what Jedi we have left
and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.
1002
01:35:11,665 to 01:35:15,585
Visit I will the cloners on Kamino...
1003
01:35:16,587 to 01:35:20,881
and see this army
they have created for the Republic.
1004
01:35:40,944 to 01:35:43,029
See those columns of steam straight ahead?
1005
01:35:43,113 to 01:35:45,197
They're exhaust vents of some type.
1006
01:35:45,991 to 01:35:48,034
That'll do.
1007
01:35:57,336 to 01:36:00,421
Look, whatever happens
out there, follow my lead.
1008
01:36:00,505 to 01:36:02,590
I'm not interested in
getting into a war here.
1009
01:36:02,674 to 01:36:04,383
As a member of the senate...
1010
01:36:04,468 to 01:36:07,845
maybe I can find
a diplomatic solution to this mess.
1011
01:36:07,929 to 01:36:09,930
Don't worry.
1012
01:36:10,015 to 01:36:12,475
I've given up trying to argue with you.
1013
01:36:17,189 to 01:36:20,441
My obtuse little friend,
if they had needed our help...
1014
01:36:20,525 to 01:36:22,443
they would have asked for it.
1015
01:36:22,527 to 01:36:25,696
You obviously have a great deal
to learn about human behavior.
1016
01:36:51,556 to 01:36:54,767
For a mechanic, you seem to do
an excessive amount of thinking.
1017
01:36:56,812 to 01:36:59,438
I am programmed to understand humans!
1018
01:37:02,984 to 01:37:04,902
"What does that mean?"
1019
01:37:04,986 to 01:37:07,738
That means I am in charge here!
1020
01:37:07,823 to 01:37:09,490
Where are you going now?
1021
01:37:09,574 to 01:37:13,327
You don't know what's out there.
Have you no sense at all?
1022
01:37:13,412 to 01:37:15,162
Idiot!
1023
01:37:17,249 to 01:37:19,083
Please wait.
1024
01:37:19,876 to 01:37:21,877
Do you know where you're going?
1025
01:37:34,307 to 01:37:36,100
Wait.
1026
01:38:51,676 to 01:38:53,594
Oh, my goodness!
1027
01:38:53,678 to 01:38:55,304
Shut me down!
1028
01:38:56,181 to 01:38:58,349
Machines making machines.
1029
01:38:58,433 to 01:38:59,975
How perverse!
1030
01:39:00,852 to 01:39:02,311
Calm down, R2!
1031
01:39:02,395 to 01:39:04,897
I almost fell.
1032
01:39:04,981 to 01:39:07,024
You'll get your chance...
1033
01:39:08,819 to 01:39:10,861
I'm scrap.
1034
01:39:11,863 to 01:39:14,281
It's a nightmare!
1035
01:39:16,034 to 01:39:18,035
I want to go home!
1036
01:39:19,538 to 01:39:21,497
What did I do to deserve this?
1037
01:40:01,204 to 01:40:03,622
I wonder what happened to poor little R2.
1038
01:40:03,707 to 01:40:06,125
He's always getting himself into trouble.
1039
01:40:07,419 to 01:40:09,086
Oh, no!
1040
01:40:18,430 to 01:40:20,139
Uh-oh.
1041
01:40:23,727 to 01:40:25,769
I'm so confused.
1042
01:42:21,678 to 01:42:23,637
Not again!
1043
01:42:23,722 to 01:42:25,764
Obi-Wan's gonna kill me.
1044
01:42:34,774 to 01:42:36,316
Don't move, Jedi!
1045
01:42:36,401 to 01:42:37,943
Take him away.
1046
01:42:56,921 to 01:42:58,797
Don't be afraid.
1047
01:43:00,508 to 01:43:02,593
I'm not afraid to die.
1048
01:43:07,348 to 01:43:11,560
I've been dying a little bit each day
since you came back into my life.
1049
01:43:12,771 to 01:43:15,397
What are you talking about?
1050
01:43:16,691 to 01:43:18,942
I love you.
1051
01:43:22,614 to 01:43:24,615
You love me?
1052
01:43:29,079 to 01:43:32,372
I thought we had decided
not to fall in love...
1053
01:43:34,084 to 01:43:37,127
that we would be forced to live a lie...
1054
01:43:37,962 to 01:43:41,006
and that it would destroy our lives.
1055
01:43:41,633 to 01:43:44,134
I think our lives are about
to be destroyed anyway.
1056
01:43:49,140 to 01:43:51,141
I truly...
1057
01:43:52,102 to 01:43:54,561
deeply love you...
1058
01:43:55,730 to 01:43:58,315
and before we die, I want you to know.
1059
01:44:55,456 to 01:44:58,125
I was beginning to wonder
if you'd got my message.
1060
01:44:58,209 to 01:45:01,295
I retransmitted it
just as you had requested, Master.
1061
01:45:03,631 to 01:45:05,549
Then we decided to come and rescue you.
1062
01:45:06,467 to 01:45:08,051
Good job.
1063
01:45:20,356 to 01:45:23,442
Settle down. Settle down.
1064
01:45:27,405 to 01:45:31,200
Let the executions begin.
1065
01:46:03,900 to 01:46:06,902
I've got a bad feeling about this.
1066
01:46:32,387 to 01:46:34,930
Just relax. Concentrate.
What about Padmé?
1067
01:46:35,014 to 01:46:37,182
She seems to be on top of things.
1068
01:47:40,121 to 01:47:41,872
She can't do that!
1069
01:47:41,956 to 01:47:43,915
Shoot her... or something!
1070
01:49:02,703 to 01:49:04,162
Jump!
1071
01:49:28,229 to 01:49:31,314
This isn't how it's supposed to be!
1072
01:49:31,399 to 01:49:33,567
Jango! Finish her off!
1073
01:49:33,651 to 01:49:36,903
Patience, Viceroy, patience. She will die.
1074
01:50:07,685 to 01:50:09,227
Master Windu.
1075
01:50:09,312 to 01:50:11,646
How pleasant of you to join us.
1076
01:50:11,731 to 01:50:13,815
This party's over.
1077
01:50:27,330 to 01:50:29,623
Brave...
1078
01:50:29,707 to 01:50:32,083
but foolish, my old Jedi friend.
1079
01:50:32,168 to 01:50:34,044
You're impossibly outnumbered.
1080
01:50:34,128 to 01:50:36,463
I don't think so.
1081
01:50:36,547 to 01:50:38,048
We'll see.
1082
01:51:16,754 to 01:51:19,422
My legs aren't moving.
I must need maintenance.
1083
01:51:59,005 to 01:52:01,590
What's all this noise? A battle!
1084
01:52:01,674 to 01:52:03,883
There's been some terrible mistake!
1085
01:52:03,968 to 01:52:06,761
I'm programmed for etiquette,
not destruction!
1086
01:53:34,225 to 01:53:36,101
Die, Jedi dogs!
1087
01:53:36,185 to 01:53:38,019
Oh! What did I say?
1088
01:53:47,029 to 01:53:50,407
Oh, dear.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.
1089
01:53:55,996 to 01:53:58,957
Excuse me. I'm trapped. I can't get up.
1090
01:54:12,847 to 01:54:16,933
You call this a diplomatic solution?
No, I call it aggressive negotiations.
1091
01:54:22,022 to 01:54:24,065
Uh-oh.
Roger, roger.
1092
01:54:42,168 to 01:54:44,461
R2, what are you doing here?
1093
01:54:47,631 to 01:54:49,007
What are you doing?
1094
01:54:49,091 to 01:54:51,718
Stop that!
You're going to strain something.
1095
01:54:51,802 to 01:54:53,636
My neck!
1096
01:54:55,890 to 01:54:58,975
Now where are you taking me?
This is such a drag!
1097
01:55:03,939 to 01:55:06,024
I'm quite beside myself.
1098
01:55:14,700 to 01:55:17,952
R2, please be careful!
You're singeing my circuits!
1099
01:55:19,371 to 01:55:21,956
Yes, but is my head on straight?
1100
01:55:44,647 to 01:55:46,314
Master Windu...
1101
01:55:46,398 to 01:55:48,691
you have fought gallantly...
1102
01:55:49,777 to 01:55:53,863
worthy of recognition
in the archives of the Jedi order.
1103
01:55:55,783 to 01:55:57,158
Now...
1104
01:55:58,035 to 01:56:00,495
it is finished.
1105
01:56:00,579 to 01:56:02,580
Surrender...
1106
01:56:02,665 to 01:56:05,416
and your lives will be spared.
1107
01:56:06,126 to 01:56:09,379
We will not be hostages
to be bartered, Dooku!
1108
01:56:09,463 to 01:56:10,547
Then...
1109
01:56:11,966 to 01:56:14,092
I'm sorry, old friend.
1110
01:56:24,728 to 01:56:26,229
Look!
1111
01:56:37,908 to 01:56:42,203
Around the survivors a perimeter create.
1112
01:57:38,636 to 01:57:41,763
I've had the most peculiar dream!
1113
01:57:52,316 to 01:57:54,317
If Dooku escapes...
1114
01:57:54,401 to 01:57:58,154
rally more systems to his cause he will.
1115
01:58:02,660 to 01:58:04,494
Hold on!
1116
01:58:09,041 to 01:58:11,042
Aim right above the fuel cells!
1117
01:58:17,341 to 01:58:19,634
Good call, my young Padawan.
1118
01:58:33,649 to 01:58:36,192
The Jedi have amassed a huge army.
1119
01:58:36,276 to 01:58:38,444
That doesn't seem possible.
1120
01:58:38,529 to 01:58:41,155
How could the Jedi
come up with an army so quickly?
1121
01:58:41,240 to 01:58:44,701
We must send all available
droids into battle.
1122
01:58:44,785 to 01:58:46,744
There are too many.
1123
01:58:47,454 to 01:58:50,498
Our communications have been jammed.
1124
01:58:58,382 to 01:59:01,592
Pilot, land in that assembly area!
1125
01:59:01,677 to 01:59:03,052
Yes, sir.
1126
01:59:11,061 to 01:59:15,064
Sir. I have five special commando units
awaiting your orders, sir.
1127
01:59:16,066 to 01:59:19,402
To the forward command center take me.
1128
01:59:42,676 to 01:59:45,470
Attack those Federation starships, quickly!
1129
01:59:56,398 to 02:00:00,234
Master Yoda,
all forward positions are advancing.
1130
02:00:00,319 to 02:00:02,195
Very good.
1131
02:00:02,780 to 02:00:04,447
Very good.
1132
02:00:32,643 to 02:00:34,811
This is not looking good at all!
1133
02:00:36,313 to 02:00:39,315
We must get the starships back into space.
1134
02:00:42,319 to 02:00:46,280
We have to order a retreat.
1135
02:00:46,365 to 02:00:48,741
My master will never allow the Republic...
1136
02:00:48,826 to 02:00:51,202
to get away with this treachery.
1137
02:00:51,286 to 02:00:54,539
I'm sending my warriors
to hide in the catacombs.
1138
02:00:55,290 to 02:00:58,668
The Jedi must not find
our designs for the ultimate weapon.
1139
02:01:01,088 to 02:01:06,467
If they find out what we are planning
to build, we're doomed.
1140
02:01:09,513 to 02:01:12,140
I will take the designs
with me to Coruscant.
1141
02:01:12,933 to 02:01:15,768
They will be much safer
there with my master.
1142
02:02:10,282 to 02:02:15,077
Concentrate all your fire
on the nearest starship.
1143
02:02:15,162 to 02:02:17,038
Yes, sir.
1144
02:02:17,122 to 02:02:20,625
Move all quadrants to sector 515.
1145
02:03:00,707 to 02:03:02,250
Look over there!
1146
02:03:05,671 to 02:03:08,089
It's Dooku! Shoot him down!
1147
02:03:08,173 to 02:03:10,091
We're out of rockets, sir.
1148
02:03:10,175 to 02:03:13,052
Follow him!
We're gonna need some help!
1149
02:03:13,136 to 02:03:17,265
There isn't time!
Anakin and I can handle this!
1150
02:03:40,664 to 02:03:43,291
Put the ship down!
1151
02:03:43,375 to 02:03:45,293
Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way!
1152
02:03:45,377 to 02:03:47,169
Follow that speeder!
1153
02:03:53,218 to 02:03:55,594
Lower the ship!
I can't take Dooku alone!
1154
02:03:55,679 to 02:03:59,181
I need you! If we catch him,
we can end this war right now!
1155
02:03:59,266 to 02:04:02,310
We have a job to do!
I don't care! Put the ship down!
1156
02:04:02,394 to 02:04:04,687
You will be expelled from the Jedi order!
1157
02:04:04,771 to 02:04:08,024
I can't leave her!
Come to your senses!
1158
02:04:08,108 to 02:04:10,818
What do you think Padmé would do
were she in your position?
1159
02:04:15,365 to 02:04:17,450
She would do her duty.
1160
02:04:26,376 to 02:04:28,377
The droid army is in full retreat.
1161
02:04:28,462 to 02:04:31,714
Well done, Commander. Bring me a ship.
1162
02:04:58,784 to 02:05:01,827
You're gonna pay for all the Jedi
that you killed today, Dooku.
1163
02:05:01,912 to 02:05:03,621
We'll take him together.
1164
02:05:03,705 to 02:05:05,748
I'm taking him now!
No, Anakin! No!
1165
02:05:13,757 to 02:05:17,343
As you see, my Jedi powers
are far beyond yours.
1166
02:05:17,427 to 02:05:19,428
Now... back down.
1167
02:05:25,227 to 02:05:27,103
I don't think so.
1168
02:05:39,408 to 02:05:42,618
Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.
1169
02:05:42,702 to 02:05:45,830
Yoda holds you in such high esteem.
1170
02:05:48,166 to 02:05:50,626
Surely you can do better.
1171
02:06:01,763 to 02:06:03,681
Are you all right?
1172
02:06:03,765 to 02:06:05,474
Uh-huh.
1173
02:06:06,059 to 02:06:08,352
We'd better get back
to the forward command center.
1174
02:06:08,437 to 02:06:10,062
No.
1175
02:06:10,147 to 02:06:13,691
Gather what troops you can.
We've got to get to that hangar.
1176
02:06:13,775 to 02:06:15,734
Get a transport. Hurry!
1177
02:06:15,819 to 02:06:16,986
Right away.
1178
02:06:42,053 to 02:06:43,971
Brave of you, boy.
1179
02:06:45,182 to 02:06:47,433
But I would have thought
you had learned your lesson.
1180
02:06:47,517 to 02:06:49,185
I am a slow learner.
1181
02:07:51,581 to 02:07:53,374
Master Yoda.
1182
02:07:53,458 to 02:07:56,544
Count Dooku.
1183
02:07:56,628 to 02:08:00,005
You have interfered with our affairs
for the last time.
1184
02:08:31,121 to 02:08:34,540
Powerful you have become, Dooku.
1185
02:08:34,624 to 02:08:37,835
The dark side I sense in you.
1186
02:08:37,919 to 02:08:40,754
I've become more powerful than any Jedi.
1187
02:08:41,798 to 02:08:43,507
Even you.
1188
02:08:58,648 to 02:09:01,942
Much to learn you still have.
1189
02:09:02,027 to 02:09:05,237
It is obvious that this contest
cannot be decided...
1190
02:09:05,322 to 02:09:07,615
by our knowledge of the Force...
1191
02:09:09,492 to 02:09:12,286
but by our skills with a lightsaber.
1192
02:09:53,703 to 02:09:57,247
Fought well you have, my old Padawan.
1193
02:09:57,332 to 02:09:59,166
This is just the beginning.
1194
02:12:32,111 to 02:12:34,780
The Force is with us, Master Sidious.
1195
02:12:34,864 to 02:12:37,866
Welcome home, Lord Tyranus.
1196
02:12:39,577 to 02:12:42,329
You have done well.
1197
02:12:42,413 to 02:12:44,540
I have good news for you, my lord.
1198
02:12:45,917 to 02:12:49,419
The war has begun.
Excellent.
1199
02:12:49,504 to 02:12:52,381
Everything is going as planned.
1200
02:13:02,308 to 02:13:06,311
Do you believe what Count Dooku said
about Sidious controlling the senate?
1201
02:13:06,813 to 02:13:09,064
It doesn't feel right.
1202
02:13:09,148 to 02:13:12,192
Joined the dark side Dooku has.
1203
02:13:13,736 to 02:13:15,195
Lies, deceit...
1204
02:13:15,280 to 02:13:19,074
creating mistrust are his ways now.
1205
02:13:19,158 to 02:13:20,617
Nevertheless...
1206
02:13:20,702 to 02:13:23,745
I feel we should keep
a closer eye on the senate.
1207
02:13:23,830 to 02:13:25,914
I agree.
1208
02:13:27,000 to 02:13:28,917
Where is your apprentice?
1209
02:13:29,002 to 02:13:32,921
On his way to Naboo,
escorting Senator Amidala home.
1210
02:13:34,674 to 02:13:38,343
I have to admit that without the clones,
it would not have been a victory.
1211
02:13:38,428 to 02:13:40,554
Victory?
1212
02:13:41,264 to 02:13:43,765
Victory, you say?
1213
02:13:43,850 to 02:13:47,603
Master Obi-Wan, not victory.
1214
02:13:48,980 to 02:13:52,357
The shroud of the dark side has fallen.
1215
02:13:53,776 to 02:13:57,279
Begun the Clone War has.
1216
02:22:25,830 to 02:22:26,830
English US
