1
00:02:28,816 to 00:02:32,360
Command station, this is ST321.
Code clearance blue.
2
00:02:32,445 to 00:02:35,405
We're starting our approach.
Deactivate the security shield.
3
00:02:36,157 to 00:02:38,241
The security deflector shield
will be deactivated...
4
00:02:38,325 to 00:02:40,660
when we have confirmation
of your code transmission.
5
00:02:40,745 to 00:02:41,953
Stand by.
6
00:02:43,414 to 00:02:45,331
You are clear to proceed.
7
00:02:45,416 to 00:02:47,751
We're starting our approach.
8
00:03:14,653 to 00:03:17,864
Inform the commander
that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.
9
00:03:17,948 to 00:03:19,074
Sir.
10
00:03:55,903 to 00:03:58,947
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected
pleasure. We're honored.
11
00:03:59,031 to 00:04:01,366
You may dispense
with the pleasantries, Commander.
12
00:04:01,450 to 00:04:03,993
I'm here to put you back on schedule.
13
00:04:04,078 to 00:04:07,163
I assure you, Lord Vader,
my men are working as fast as they can.
14
00:04:07,248 to 00:04:10,708
Perhaps I can find new ways
to motivate them.
15
00:04:12,002 to 00:04:15,004
I tell you this station
will be operational as planned.
16
00:04:15,756 to 00:04:21,094
The emperor does not share your
optimistic appraisal of the situation.
17
00:04:21,178 to 00:04:24,430
But he asks the impossible.
I need more men.
18
00:04:24,515 to 00:04:27,684
Then perhaps you can tell him
when he arrives.
19
00:04:28,894 to 00:04:32,438
The emperor's coming here?
That is correct, Commander...
20
00:04:32,523 to 00:04:37,360
and he is most displeased with
your apparent lack of progress.
21
00:04:38,070 to 00:04:39,904
We shall double our efforts.
22
00:04:39,989 to 00:04:43,324
I hope so, Commander, for your sake.
23
00:04:43,409 to 00:04:47,370
The emperor is not as forgiving as I am.
24
00:05:05,222 to 00:05:07,724
Of course I'm worried.
And you should be too.
25
00:05:07,808 to 00:05:11,644
Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca
never returned from this awful place.
26
00:05:14,023 to 00:05:16,065
Don't be so sure.
27
00:05:16,150 to 00:05:19,485
If I told you half the things
I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt...
28
00:05:19,570 to 00:05:21,487
you'd probably shortcircuit.
29
00:05:34,084 to 00:05:36,085
R2, are you sure this is the right place?
30
00:05:41,133 to 00:05:43,301
I'd better knock, I suppose.
31
00:05:45,095 to 00:05:49,098
There doesn't seem to be anyone here.
Let's go back and tell Master Luke.
32
00:05:52,603 to 00:05:54,562
Goodness gracious me!
33
00:06:17,836 to 00:06:20,255
I don't think
they're going to let us in, R2.
34
00:06:22,007 to 00:06:23,967
We'd better go.
35
00:06:32,977 to 00:06:34,477
R2, wait.
36
00:06:36,522 to 00:06:38,523
Oh, dear. R2.
37
00:06:38,607 to 00:06:41,943
R2, I really don't think
we should rush into all this.
38
00:06:42,945 to 00:06:44,904
Oh, R2!
39
00:06:44,989 to 00:06:46,781
R2, wait for me!
40
00:06:53,872 to 00:06:57,458
Just you deliver Master Luke's message
and get us out of here.
41
00:06:57,543 to 00:06:59,544
Oh, my!
42
00:07:03,465 to 00:07:04,632
Oh, no.
43
00:07:09,680 to 00:07:11,097
Oh, my.
44
00:07:16,145 to 00:07:18,980
We bring a message
to your master, Jabba the Hutt.
45
00:07:22,693 to 00:07:24,944
And a gift.
46
00:07:25,029 to 00:07:26,404
What gift?
47
00:07:42,880 to 00:07:48,176
He says that our instructions
are to give it only to Jabba himself.
48
00:07:57,978 to 00:08:01,731
I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever
so stubborn about these sort of things.
49
00:08:04,109 to 00:08:07,570
R2, I have a bad feeling about this.
50
00:08:42,356 to 00:08:44,273
Good morning.
51
00:08:49,488 to 00:08:51,781
The message, R2. The message.
52
00:09:01,708 to 00:09:03,459
Greetings, Exalted One.
53
00:09:03,544 to 00:09:05,878
Allow me to introduce myself.
54
00:09:05,963 to 00:09:09,924
I am Luke Skywalker,
Jedi knight and friend to Captain Solo.
55
00:09:10,634 to 00:09:13,344
I know that you are powerful,
mighty Jabba...
56
00:09:13,429 to 00:09:17,140
and that your anger with Solo
must be equally powerful.
57
00:09:17,224 to 00:09:21,102
I seek an audience with Your Greatness
to bargain for Solo's life.
58
00:09:24,815 to 00:09:27,483
With your wisdom, I'm sure
we can work out an arrangement...
59
00:09:27,568 to 00:09:29,318
which will be mutually beneficial...
60
00:09:29,403 to 00:09:32,155
and enable us to avoid
any unpleasant confrontation.
61
00:09:34,116 to 00:09:37,410
As a token of my goodwill,
I present to you a gift...
62
00:09:37,494 to 00:09:39,287
these two droids.
63
00:09:39,371 to 00:09:41,289
What did he say?
64
00:09:41,373 to 00:09:44,959
Both are hardworking
and will serve you well.
65
00:09:45,043 to 00:09:48,838
This can't be.
R2, you're playing the wrong message.
66
00:09:55,387 to 00:09:57,221
He's no Jedi.
67
00:09:59,808 to 00:10:03,686
There will be no bargain.
68
00:10:03,770 to 00:10:06,022
We're doomed.
69
00:10:06,106 to 00:10:13,112
I will not give up my favorite decoration.
70
00:10:14,573 to 00:10:18,034
I like Captain Solo where he is.
71
00:10:19,703 to 00:10:21,829
R2, look. Captain Solo.
72
00:10:21,914 to 00:10:24,499
And he's still frozen in carbonite.
73
00:10:37,596 to 00:10:40,097
What could possibly
have come over Master Luke?
74
00:10:41,099 to 00:10:45,102
Was it something I did? He never
expressed any unhappiness with my work.
75
00:10:46,104 to 00:10:47,605
How horrid!
76
00:11:16,426 to 00:11:19,011
Good. New acquisitions.
77
00:11:19,096 to 00:11:21,764
You are a protocol droid, are you not?
78
00:11:21,848 to 00:11:23,808
I am C3PO...
79
00:11:23,892 to 00:11:25,685
Yes or no will do.
80
00:11:25,769 to 00:11:27,311
Well, yes.
81
00:11:27,396 to 00:11:29,939
How many languages do you speak?
82
00:11:30,023 to 00:11:33,693
I am fluent in over six million forms
of communication and can readily...
83
00:11:33,777 to 00:11:36,445
Splendid. We have been
without an interpreter...
84
00:11:36,530 to 00:11:39,907
since our master got angry
with our last protocol droid...
85
00:11:39,992 to 00:11:41,826
and disintegrated him.
86
00:11:41,910 to 00:11:43,536
Disintegrated?
87
00:11:48,458 to 00:11:52,253
Guard, this protocol droid might be useful.
88
00:11:52,337 to 00:11:54,547
Fit him with a restraining bolt...
89
00:11:54,631 to 00:11:58,009
and take him back up to
His Excellency's main audience chamber.
90
00:11:58,093 to 00:12:00,595
R2, don't leave me!
91
00:12:05,767 to 00:12:07,893
You're a feisty little one...
92
00:12:07,978 to 00:12:10,479
but you'll soon learn some respect.
93
00:12:10,564 to 00:12:13,899
I have need for you on
the master's sail barge...
94
00:12:13,984 to 00:12:16,736
and I think you'll fill in nicely.
95
00:12:45,307 to 00:12:48,726
Ah! Do that again!
96
00:14:42,048 to 00:14:46,302
I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.
97
00:14:47,304 to 00:14:48,637
Oh, no. Chewbacca.
98
00:14:52,309 to 00:14:56,979
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.
99
00:15:02,736 to 00:15:05,571
Yes, I am here, Your Worshipfulness.
100
00:15:06,698 to 00:15:08,032
Yes?
101
00:15:17,250 to 00:15:19,251
The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome...
102
00:15:19,336 to 00:15:21,962
and will gladly pay you
the reward of 25,000.
103
00:15:22,964 to 00:15:25,049
I want 50,000. No less.
104
00:15:25,801 to 00:15:27,843
"50,000. No less."
105
00:15:40,857 to 00:15:42,525
What did I say?
106
00:15:48,824 to 00:15:51,534
The mighty Jabba asks
why he must pay 50,000.
107
00:15:55,497 to 00:15:57,832
Because he's holding a thermal detonator.
108
00:16:09,094 to 00:16:13,639
This bounty hunter is my kind of scum...
109
00:16:14,558 to 00:16:17,393
fearless and inventive.
110
00:16:26,778 to 00:16:29,655
Jabba offers the sum of 35...
111
00:16:29,739 to 00:16:31,949
and I do suggest you take it.
112
00:16:37,455 to 00:16:39,123
He agrees!
113
00:19:29,252 to 00:19:31,712
Just relax for a moment.
114
00:19:31,796 to 00:19:34,465
You're free of the carbonite.
115
00:19:36,509 to 00:19:40,012
You have hibernation sickness.
116
00:19:40,096 to 00:19:44,600
I can't see.
Your eyesight will return in time.
117
00:19:44,684 to 00:19:48,020
Where am I?
Jabba's palace.
118
00:19:51,274 to 00:19:52,941
Who are you?
119
00:19:57,906 to 00:20:00,449
Someone who loves you.
Leia.
120
00:20:03,953 to 00:20:05,954
I gotta get you out of here.
121
00:20:08,583 to 00:20:10,375
What's that?
122
00:20:13,088 to 00:20:15,005
I know that laugh.
123
00:20:20,929 to 00:20:22,262
Hey, Jabba.
124
00:20:22,347 to 00:20:25,224
Look, Jabba, I was just
on my way to pay you back.
125
00:20:25,308 to 00:20:28,227
I got a little sidetracked.
It's not my fault.
126
00:20:28,311 to 00:20:32,064
It's too late for that, Solo.
127
00:20:32,148 to 00:20:36,902
You may have been a good smuggler...
128
00:20:36,986 to 00:20:40,489
but now you're bantha fodder.
129
00:20:45,120 to 00:20:46,161
Look...
130
00:20:47,372 to 00:20:49,456
Take him away.
131
00:20:49,541 to 00:20:51,333
Jabba, I'll pay you triple.
132
00:20:51,417 to 00:20:53,961
You're throwing away a fortune here.
Don't be a fool.
133
00:20:56,840 to 00:20:59,049
Bring her to me.
134
00:21:03,304 to 00:21:05,347
We have powerful friends.
135
00:21:05,431 to 00:21:07,516
You're gonna regret this.
136
00:21:09,352 to 00:21:11,311
I'm sure.
137
00:21:15,275 to 00:21:17,192
I can't bear to watch.
138
00:21:31,708 to 00:21:33,208
Chewie?
139
00:21:34,961 to 00:21:36,962
Chewie, is that you?
140
00:21:38,882 to 00:21:41,550
Wait a minute. I can't see, pal.
141
00:21:42,552 to 00:21:44,511
What's going on?
142
00:21:47,015 to 00:21:48,640
Luke? Luke's crazy.
143
00:21:48,725 to 00:21:52,311
He can't even take care of himself,
much less rescue anybody.
144
00:21:54,147 to 00:21:55,981
A Jedi knight?
145
00:21:56,816 to 00:22:00,736
I'm out of it for a little while,
everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
146
00:22:04,157 to 00:22:06,074
I'm all right, pal.
147
00:22:07,994 to 00:22:09,494
I'm all right.
148
00:23:03,508 to 00:23:05,467
I must speak with Jabba.
149
00:23:10,807 to 00:23:12,641
No bargain.
150
00:23:12,725 to 00:23:15,227
You will take me to Jabba now.
151
00:23:19,649 to 00:23:21,483
You serve your master well.
152
00:23:23,403 to 00:23:25,362
And you will be rewarded.
153
00:23:34,205 to 00:23:37,499
At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.
154
00:23:37,583 to 00:23:38,917
Master.
155
00:23:41,087 to 00:23:44,214
Luke Skywalker, Jedi knight.
156
00:23:44,299 to 00:23:48,593
I told you not to admit him.
157
00:23:48,678 to 00:23:50,512
I must be allowed to speak.
158
00:23:50,596 to 00:23:53,390
He must be allowed to speak.
159
00:23:54,183 to 00:23:57,185
You weakminded fool!
160
00:23:59,188 to 00:24:03,567
He's using an old Jedi mind trick.
161
00:24:03,651 to 00:24:07,195
You will bring Captain Solo
and the Wookiee to me.
162
00:24:13,077 to 00:24:18,290
Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.
163
00:24:18,374 to 00:24:20,584
Nevertheless...
164
00:24:20,668 to 00:24:23,670
I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends.
165
00:24:23,755 to 00:24:27,632
You can either profit by this
or be destroyed.
166
00:24:27,717 to 00:24:30,719
It's your choice, but I warn you
not to underestimate my powers.
167
00:24:32,930 to 00:24:35,057
Master Luke, you're standing on...
168
00:24:35,141 to 00:24:39,770
There will be no bargain, young Jedi.
169
00:24:40,938 to 00:24:44,524
I shall enjoy watching you die.
170
00:25:15,556 to 00:25:18,225
Oh, no! The rancor!
171
00:28:05,476 to 00:28:09,187
Bring me Solo and the Wookiee.
172
00:28:09,272 to 00:28:13,525
They will all suffer for this outrage.
173
00:28:28,457 to 00:28:29,457
Han.
174
00:28:32,920 to 00:28:36,172
Are you all right?
Fine. Together again, huh?
175
00:28:36,257 to 00:28:38,717
Wouldn't miss it.
How are we doin'?
176
00:28:38,801 to 00:28:41,511
Same as always.
That bad, huh?
177
00:28:41,596 to 00:28:44,139
Where's Leia?
I'm here.
178
00:28:47,727 to 00:28:49,227
Oh, dear.
179
00:28:50,229 to 00:28:53,189
His High Exaltedness,
the great Jabba the Hutt...
180
00:28:53,274 to 00:28:56,359
has decreed that you are
to be terminated immediately.
181
00:28:56,444 to 00:28:58,153
Good. I hate long waits.
182
00:29:00,489 to 00:29:03,116
You will therefore be taken
to the Dune Sea...
183
00:29:03,200 to 00:29:05,577
and cast into the Pit of Carkoon...
184
00:29:05,661 to 00:29:07,996
nesting place of the allpowerful Sarlacc.
185
00:29:08,080 to 00:29:09,331
Doesn't sound so bad.
186
00:29:09,415 to 00:29:13,335
In his belly, you will find a new
definition of pain and suffering...
187
00:29:13,419 to 00:29:16,546
as you are slowly digested
over 1,000 years.
188
00:29:18,007 to 00:29:20,258
On second thought, let's pass on that.
189
00:29:20,343 to 00:29:21,968
You should have bargained, Jabba.
190
00:29:25,681 to 00:29:28,224
That's the last mistake you'll ever make.
191
00:30:19,735 to 00:30:21,486
I think my eyes are getting better.
192
00:30:21,570 to 00:30:24,739
Instead of a big dark blur,
I see a big light blur.
193
00:30:25,741 to 00:30:28,785
There's nothing to see.
I used to live here, you know.
194
00:30:28,869 to 00:30:31,746
You're gonna die here, you know.
Convenient.
195
00:30:31,831 to 00:30:34,165
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando.
196
00:30:34,250 to 00:30:36,626
I've taken care of everything.
197
00:30:37,461 to 00:30:38,795
Great.
198
00:30:42,883 to 00:30:49,264
Soon you will learn to appreciate me.
199
00:30:51,142 to 00:30:52,475
I'm terribly sorry.
200
00:30:52,560 to 00:30:55,520
R2, what are you doing here?
201
00:30:55,604 to 00:30:58,690
I can see you're serving drinks,
but this place is dangerous.
202
00:30:58,774 to 00:31:01,776
They're going to execute Master Luke,
and if we're not careful, us too.
203
00:31:04,697 to 00:31:06,614
I wish I had your confidence.
204
00:31:29,930 to 00:31:32,098
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc...
205
00:31:32,183 to 00:31:35,351
His Excellency hopes
that you will die honorably.
206
00:31:37,188 to 00:31:39,856
But should any of you
wish to beg for mercy...
207
00:31:39,940 to 00:31:43,985
the great Jabba the Hutt
will now listen to your pleas.
208
00:31:48,115 to 00:31:53,495
3PO, you tell that slimy piece
of wormridden filth...
209
00:31:53,579 to 00:31:56,247
he'll get no such pleasure from us!
210
00:31:56,332 to 00:31:58,166
Right?
211
00:32:01,420 to 00:32:03,546
This is your last chance.
212
00:32:03,631 to 00:32:05,799
Free us or die.
213
00:32:10,179 to 00:32:13,014
Move him into position.
214
00:32:37,164 to 00:32:39,499
Put him in.
215
00:33:03,858 to 00:33:05,400
Easy, Chewie.
216
00:33:15,286 to 00:33:16,786
Help!
217
00:33:23,502 to 00:33:25,753
Chewie, you're hit? Where is it?
218
00:33:31,802 to 00:33:33,303
Han, Chewie!
219
00:33:33,387 to 00:33:34,470
Lando.
220
00:33:42,938 to 00:33:43,938
Boba Fett?
221
00:33:46,066 to 00:33:47,400
Boba Fett? Where?
222
00:34:20,517 to 00:34:22,560
Lando, grab it!
Lower it!
223
00:34:22,645 to 00:34:24,103
I'm trying!
224
00:34:46,168 to 00:34:48,670
Grab me, Chewie. Grab it!
225
00:35:01,308 to 00:35:03,643
Grab it. Almost. You almost got it.
226
00:35:12,945 to 00:35:14,320
Gently, now.
227
00:35:14,405 to 00:35:16,531
Easy. Hold me, Chewie.
228
00:35:28,210 to 00:35:29,794
Chewie, give me the gun.
229
00:35:29,878 to 00:35:32,922
Don't move, Lando.
Wait! I thought you were blind!
230
00:35:33,007 to 00:35:35,049
I can see a lot better. Don't move.
231
00:35:35,134 to 00:35:36,718
A little higher!
232
00:35:39,847 to 00:35:41,889
Chewie, pull us up.
233
00:35:42,975 to 00:35:44,559
Up, Chewie. Up.
234
00:35:46,353 to 00:35:48,021
We gotta get out of here.
235
00:35:48,647 to 00:35:50,523
Not my eyes! R2, help!
236
00:35:51,567 to 00:35:52,567
Quickly, R2!
237
00:35:54,028 to 00:35:55,111
Beast!
238
00:36:00,617 to 00:36:02,326
Get the gun!
239
00:36:02,411 to 00:36:03,745
Point it at the deck.
240
00:36:09,209 to 00:36:10,793
Point it at the deck!
241
00:36:14,548 to 00:36:17,133
R2, where are we going?
I couldn't possibly...
242
00:36:22,306 to 00:36:23,806
Come on.
243
00:36:31,899 to 00:36:34,317
Let's go. Don't forget the droids.
We're on our way.
244
00:37:13,816 to 00:37:15,608
I'll meet you back at the fleet.
245
00:37:15,692 to 00:37:18,361
Hurry. The Alliance
should be assembled by now.
246
00:37:18,445 to 00:37:21,155
I will.
Luke, thanks.
247
00:37:21,240 to 00:37:24,534
Thanks for coming after me.
Now I owe you one.
248
00:37:30,207 to 00:37:32,667
That's right, R2.
We're going to the Dagobah system.
249
00:37:39,049 to 00:37:41,342
I have a promise to keep...
250
00:37:41,426 to 00:37:43,427
to an old friend.
251
00:38:34,563 to 00:38:36,063
Rise, my friend.
252
00:38:42,738 to 00:38:46,073
The Death Star
will be completed on schedule.
253
00:38:46,575 to 00:38:49,327
You've done well, Lord Vader.
254
00:38:49,411 to 00:38:55,291
Now I sense you wish to continue
your search for young Skywalker.
255
00:38:57,878 to 00:38:59,212
Yes, my master.
256
00:38:59,922 to 00:39:02,590
Patience, my friend.
257
00:39:02,674 to 00:39:06,052
In time, he will seek you out.
258
00:39:06,136 to 00:39:10,598
When he does, you must bring him before me.
259
00:39:10,682 to 00:39:13,017
He has grown strong.
260
00:39:13,101 to 00:39:18,814
Only together can we turn him
to the dark side of the Force.
261
00:39:18,899 to 00:39:20,733
As you wish.
262
00:39:22,277 to 00:39:26,322
Everything is proceeding
as I have foreseen.
263
00:39:52,766 to 00:39:54,642
That face you make...
264
00:39:55,644 to 00:39:58,229
Look I so old to young eyes?
265
00:39:58,313 to 00:40:00,147
No, of course not.
266
00:40:01,483 to 00:40:02,984
I do.
267
00:40:06,238 to 00:40:08,072
Yes, I do.
268
00:40:10,367 to 00:40:12,910
Sick have I become.
269
00:40:12,995 to 00:40:14,996
Old and weak.
270
00:40:19,626 to 00:40:21,585
When 900 years old you reach...
271
00:40:21,670 to 00:40:23,546
look as good you will not.
272
00:40:30,387 to 00:40:32,555
Soon will I rest.
273
00:40:32,639 to 00:40:35,808
Yes. Forever sleep.
274
00:40:37,477 to 00:40:39,061
Earned it I have.
275
00:40:39,146 to 00:40:41,856
Master Yoda, you can't die.
276
00:40:43,400 to 00:40:46,110
Strong am I with the Force...
277
00:40:46,194 to 00:40:48,195
but not that strong.
278
00:40:50,866 to 00:40:56,037
Twilight is upon me,
and soon night must fall.
279
00:41:00,000 to 00:41:01,667
That is the way of things...
280
00:41:03,795 to 00:41:05,963
the way of the Force.
281
00:41:07,841 to 00:41:09,759
But I need your help.
282
00:41:09,843 to 00:41:13,054
I've come back to complete the training.
283
00:41:13,138 to 00:41:15,306
No more training do you require.
284
00:41:15,390 to 00:41:18,559
Already know you that which you need.
285
00:41:21,646 to 00:41:23,939
Then I am a Jedi.
286
00:41:30,822 to 00:41:32,531
Not yet.
287
00:41:32,616 to 00:41:34,658
One thing remains...
288
00:41:35,660 to 00:41:40,122
Vader. You must confront Vader.
289
00:41:40,874 to 00:41:45,086
Then... only then... a Jedi will you be.
290
00:41:46,755 to 00:41:48,923
And confront him you will.
291
00:41:53,553 to 00:41:55,054
Master Yoda...
292
00:41:58,767 to 00:42:01,227
is Darth Vader my father?
293
00:42:04,314 to 00:42:06,857
Rest I need.
294
00:42:06,942 to 00:42:08,401
Yes.
295
00:42:08,485 to 00:42:09,985
Rest.
296
00:42:11,947 to 00:42:14,031
Yoda, I must know.
297
00:42:18,328 to 00:42:20,579
Your father he is.
298
00:42:26,795 to 00:42:29,422
Told you, did he?
299
00:42:31,091 to 00:42:32,508
Yes.
300
00:42:34,302 to 00:42:36,637
Unexpected this is.
301
00:42:38,640 to 00:42:40,099
And unfortunate.
302
00:42:41,810 to 00:42:43,894
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
303
00:42:43,979 to 00:42:45,312
No.
304
00:42:48,483 to 00:42:52,445
Unfortunate that you rushed to face him...
305
00:42:52,529 to 00:42:55,156
that incomplete was your training...
306
00:42:56,158 to 00:42:59,702
that not ready for the burden were you.
307
00:43:01,663 to 00:43:03,330
I'm sorry.
308
00:43:04,499 to 00:43:10,045
Remember, a Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.
309
00:43:15,051 to 00:43:16,844
But beware.
310
00:43:16,928 to 00:43:20,514
Anger, fear, aggression...
311
00:43:20,599 to 00:43:23,267
the dark side are they.
312
00:43:23,351 to 00:43:27,730
Once you start down the dark path...
313
00:43:27,814 to 00:43:31,609
forever will it dominate your destiny.
314
00:43:38,825 to 00:43:40,659
Do not...
315
00:43:43,663 to 00:43:48,250
Do not underestimate
the powers of the emperor...
316
00:43:49,252 to 00:43:52,755
or suffer your father's fate you will.
317
00:43:57,177 to 00:43:59,345
When gone am I...
318
00:44:00,096 to 00:44:03,224
the last of the Jedi will you be.
319
00:44:07,562 to 00:44:11,815
The Force runs strong in your family.
320
00:44:14,277 to 00:44:17,905
Pass on what you have learned.
321
00:44:27,707 to 00:44:29,458
There is...
322
00:44:30,669 to 00:44:32,336
another...
323
00:44:36,508 to 00:44:40,886
Skywalker.
324
00:45:41,656 to 00:45:43,574
I can't do it, R2.
325
00:45:47,412 to 00:45:49,872
I can't go on alone.
326
00:45:49,956 to 00:45:52,249
Yoda will always be with you.
327
00:45:53,251 to 00:45:54,501
ObiWan.
328
00:46:02,510 to 00:46:04,136
Why didn't you tell me?
329
00:46:04,220 to 00:46:08,140
You told me Vader betrayed
and murdered my father.
330
00:46:08,224 to 00:46:13,771
Your father was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.
331
00:46:13,855 to 00:46:17,816
He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker
and became Darth Vader.
332
00:46:17,901 to 00:46:19,443
When that happened...
333
00:46:19,527 to 00:46:22,738
the good man who was
your father was destroyed.
334
00:46:23,740 to 00:46:26,241
So what I told you was true...
335
00:46:26,326 to 00:46:28,160
from a certain point of view.
336
00:46:28,244 to 00:46:30,746
A certain point of view?
337
00:46:30,830 to 00:46:34,750
Luke, you're going to find
that many of the truths we cling to...
338
00:46:34,834 to 00:46:37,836
depend greatly on our own point of view.
339
00:46:38,546 to 00:46:41,340
Anakin was a good friend.
340
00:46:42,217 to 00:46:43,842
When I first knew him...
341
00:46:43,927 to 00:46:46,136
your father was already a great pilot...
342
00:46:46,221 to 00:46:49,890
but I was amazed how strongly
the Force was with him.
343
00:46:49,974 to 00:46:53,977
I took it upon myself
to train him as a Jedi.
344
00:46:54,062 to 00:46:58,023
I thought that I could instruct him
just as well as Yoda.
345
00:46:58,108 to 00:46:59,441
I was wrong.
346
00:47:00,318 to 00:47:02,277
There is still good in him.
347
00:47:02,362 to 00:47:05,322
He's more machine now than man...
348
00:47:05,407 to 00:47:07,282
twisted and evil.
349
00:47:08,952 to 00:47:11,203
I can't do it, Ben.
350
00:47:11,287 to 00:47:13,247
You cannot escape your destiny.
351
00:47:13,331 to 00:47:16,625
You must face Darth Vader again.
352
00:47:16,710 to 00:47:19,586
I can't kill my own father.
353
00:47:22,757 to 00:47:25,884
Then the emperor has already won.
354
00:47:26,886 to 00:47:29,179
You were our only hope.
355
00:47:30,432 to 00:47:32,599
Yoda spoke of another.
356
00:47:34,519 to 00:47:37,271
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
357
00:47:38,106 to 00:47:40,107
But I have no sister.
358
00:47:41,192 to 00:47:43,152
To protect you both from the emperor...
359
00:47:43,236 to 00:47:46,864
you were hidden from your father
when you were born.
360
00:47:46,948 to 00:47:49,450
The emperor knew, as I did...
361
00:47:49,534 to 00:47:53,287
if Anakin were to have any offspring...
362
00:47:53,371 to 00:47:55,956
they would be a threat to him.
363
00:47:56,040 to 00:48:01,378
That is the reason why your sister
remains safely anonymous.
364
00:48:03,882 to 00:48:07,885
Leia is my sister.
Your insight serves you well.
365
00:48:09,137 to 00:48:12,055
Bury your feelings deep down, Luke.
366
00:48:12,140 to 00:48:14,558
They do you credit...
367
00:48:14,642 to 00:48:17,811
but they could be made
to serve the emperor.
368
00:48:40,376 to 00:48:42,920
Look at you. A general, huh?
369
00:48:43,004 to 00:48:46,131
Someone must have told them about
my maneuver at the Battle of Tanaab.
370
00:48:46,216 to 00:48:49,134
Don't look at me, pal.
I just said you were a fair pilot.
371
00:48:49,219 to 00:48:52,221
I didn't know they were looking for
somebody to lead this crazy attack.
372
00:48:52,305 to 00:48:54,515
I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.
373
00:48:55,225 to 00:48:57,309
Who says they didn't? But I ain't crazy.
374
00:48:57,393 to 00:48:59,228
You're the respectable one, remember?
375
00:49:07,529 to 00:49:10,531
The emperor's made a critical error
and the time for our attack has come.
376
00:49:11,282 to 00:49:15,202
The data brought to us by the Bothan spies
pinpoint the exact location...
377
00:49:15,286 to 00:49:17,454
of the emperor's new battle station.
378
00:49:17,539 to 00:49:19,373
We also know that the weapon systems...
379
00:49:19,457 to 00:49:21,750
of this Death Star are not yet operational.
380
00:49:21,835 to 00:49:24,837
With the imperial fleet
spread throughout the galaxy...
381
00:49:24,921 to 00:49:26,463
in a vain effort to engage us...
382
00:49:26,548 to 00:49:28,465
it is relatively unprotected.
383
00:49:28,550 to 00:49:30,676
But most important of all...
384
00:49:31,511 to 00:49:33,470
we've learned that the emperor himself...
385
00:49:33,555 to 00:49:35,722
is personally overseeing
the final stages...
386
00:49:35,807 to 00:49:38,350
of the construction of this Death Star.
387
00:49:39,143 to 00:49:43,647
Many Bothans died
to bring us this information.
388
00:49:45,650 to 00:49:47,526
Admiral Ackbar, please.
389
00:49:47,610 to 00:49:52,781
You can see here the Death Star
orbiting the forest moon of Endor.
390
00:49:52,866 to 00:49:58,370
Although the weapon systems on this
Death Star are not yet operational...
391
00:49:58,454 to 00:50:02,040
the Death Star does have
a strong defense mechanism.
392
00:50:03,251 to 00:50:05,586
It is protected by an energy shield...
393
00:50:05,670 to 00:50:09,381
which is generated
from the nearby forest moon of Endor.
394
00:50:14,429 to 00:50:18,765
The shield must be deactivated
if any attack is to be attempted.
395
00:50:20,101 to 00:50:24,062
Once the shield is down,
our cruisers will create a perimeter...
396
00:50:24,147 to 00:50:27,107
while the fighters
fly into the superstructure...
397
00:50:27,191 to 00:50:30,193
and attempt to knock out the main reactor.
398
00:50:33,031 to 00:50:36,074
General Calrissian has volunteered
to lead the fighter attack.
399
00:50:36,159 to 00:50:37,492
Good luck.
400
00:50:39,078 to 00:50:41,079
You're gonna need it.
401
00:50:41,164 to 00:50:42,915
General Madine.
402
00:50:43,917 to 00:50:46,877
We have stolen a small imperial shuttle.
403
00:50:46,961 to 00:50:51,214
Disguised as a cargo ship
and using a secret imperial code...
404
00:50:51,299 to 00:50:56,136
a strike team will land on the moon
and deactivate the shield generator.
405
00:50:56,220 to 00:50:57,512
Sounds dangerous.
406
00:50:57,597 to 00:50:59,932
Wonder who they found to pull that off.
407
00:51:00,016 to 00:51:03,101
General Solo,
is your strike team assembled?
408
00:51:03,811 to 00:51:07,147
My team's ready. I don't have
a command crew for the shuttle.
409
00:51:08,232 to 00:51:10,359
It's gonna be rough.
I didn't wanna speak for you.
410
00:51:12,779 to 00:51:16,782
That's one.
General, count me in.
411
00:51:16,866 to 00:51:18,825
I'm with you too.
412
00:51:24,666 to 00:51:27,459
What is it?
Ask me again sometime.
413
00:51:28,461 to 00:51:31,213
Hi, Han, Chewie.
414
00:51:32,298 to 00:51:34,800
"Exciting"
is hardly the word I would choose.
415
00:51:50,358 to 00:51:53,443
Look, I want you to take her.
416
00:51:53,528 to 00:51:55,112
I mean it. Take her.
417
00:51:55,196 to 00:51:58,657
You need all the help you can get.
She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
418
00:51:58,741 to 00:52:01,118
All right, old buddy.
419
00:52:01,202 to 00:52:03,245
I know what she means to you.
420
00:52:03,329 to 00:52:07,082
I'll take good care of her.
She won't get a scratch.
421
00:52:08,334 to 00:52:09,793
All right?
422
00:52:09,877 to 00:52:11,211
Right.
423
00:52:18,052 to 00:52:20,679
I got your promise. Not a scratch.
424
00:52:20,763 to 00:52:23,015
Would you get going, you pirate?
425
00:52:24,684 to 00:52:25,892
Good luck.
426
00:52:25,977 to 00:52:27,477
You too.
427
00:52:36,612 to 00:52:38,613
Got her warmed?
Yeah, she's coming up.
428
00:52:41,242 to 00:52:44,911
I don't think the Empire had Wookiees
in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
429
00:52:55,173 to 00:52:57,174
Hey, you awake?
430
00:52:57,258 to 00:53:00,761
Yeah. I just got a funny feeling,
like I'm not gonna see her again.
431
00:53:02,847 to 00:53:05,265
Come on, General. Let's move.
432
00:53:05,349 to 00:53:08,727
Right. Chewie, let's see
what this piece of junk can do.
433
00:53:08,811 to 00:53:11,063
Ready, everybody?
All set.
434
00:53:13,566 to 00:53:15,442
Here we go again.
435
00:53:26,370 to 00:53:28,330
All right, hang on.
436
00:53:44,597 to 00:53:47,140
What is thy bidding, my master?
437
00:53:48,142 to 00:53:51,603
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor.
438
00:53:54,524 to 00:53:59,152
There it will stay until called for.
439
00:54:00,488 to 00:54:04,574
What of the reports of the rebel fleet
massing near Sullust?
440
00:54:04,659 to 00:54:06,701
It is of no concern.
441
00:54:07,453 to 00:54:11,748
Soon the rebellion will be crushed
and young Skywalker will be one of us.
442
00:54:11,833 to 00:54:13,667
Your work here is finished, my friend.
443
00:54:13,751 to 00:54:16,461
Go out to the command ship
and await my orders.
444
00:54:16,546 to 00:54:18,505
Yes, my master.
445
00:54:34,188 to 00:54:37,315
If they don't go for this, we're gonna
have to get out pretty quick.
446
00:54:39,485 to 00:54:42,195
We have you on our screen now.
Please identify.
447
00:54:43,739 to 00:54:47,576
Shuttle Tydirium requesting
deactivation of the deflector shield.
448
00:54:53,207 to 00:54:57,335
Shuttle Tydirium, transmit
the clearance code for shield passage.
449
00:54:58,671 to 00:55:00,130
Transmission commencing.
450
00:55:00,214 to 00:55:03,258
Now we find out if that code
is worth the price we paid.
451
00:55:04,218 to 00:55:06,553
It'll work. It'll work.
452
00:55:07,889 to 00:55:10,098
Vader's on that ship.
453
00:55:10,183 to 00:55:12,058
Don't get jittery, Luke.
454
00:55:12,143 to 00:55:14,436
There are a lot of command ships.
455
00:55:15,438 to 00:55:19,065
Keep your distance, Chewie, but don't
look like you're keeping your distance.
456
00:55:20,276 to 00:55:22,777
I don't know. Fly casual.
457
00:55:27,992 to 00:55:29,910
Where is that shuttle going?
458
00:55:30,745 to 00:55:33,079
Shuttle Tydirium,
what is your cargo and destination?
459
00:55:35,041 to 00:55:37,125
Parts and technical crew
for the forest moon.
460
00:55:39,295 to 00:55:41,963
Do they have a code clearance?
461
00:55:42,715 to 00:55:45,008
It's an older code, sir, but it checks out.
462
00:55:45,092 to 00:55:47,093
I was about to clear them.
463
00:55:51,891 to 00:55:54,184
I'm endangering the mission.
I shouldn't have come.
464
00:55:54,268 to 00:55:56,603
It's your imagination, kid.
465
00:55:56,687 to 00:55:59,481
Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
466
00:56:07,573 to 00:56:09,115
Shall I hold them?
467
00:56:10,117 to 00:56:13,036
No. Leave them to me.
468
00:56:13,120 to 00:56:15,455
I will deal with them myself.
469
00:56:16,290 to 00:56:18,583
As you wish, my lord. Carry on.
470
00:56:20,378 to 00:56:22,295
They're not going for it, Chewie.
471
00:56:26,467 to 00:56:28,218
Shuttle Tydirium...
472
00:56:28,302 to 00:56:30,720
deactivation of the shield
will commence immediately.
473
00:56:30,805 to 00:56:33,139
Follow your present course.
474
00:56:33,224 to 00:56:35,767
Okay. I told you it was gonna work.
475
00:56:35,851 to 00:56:37,102
No problem.
476
00:57:10,428 to 00:57:12,512
I told you it was dangerous here.
477
00:57:27,903 to 00:57:31,406
Should we try and go around?
It'll take time.
478
00:57:31,490 to 00:57:34,534
This whole party will be
for nothing if they see us.
479
00:57:37,330 to 00:57:39,664
Chewie and I will take care of this.
You stay here.
480
00:57:39,749 to 00:57:42,459
Quietly. There might be
more of them out there.
481
00:57:42,543 to 00:57:43,960
Hey...
482
00:57:44,045 to 00:57:45,378
it's me.
483
00:58:10,946 to 00:58:12,989
Go for help! Go!
484
00:58:13,074 to 00:58:14,616
Great. Come on!
485
00:58:30,132 to 00:58:32,133
Over there! Two more of them.
486
00:58:33,135 to 00:58:35,470
I see them. Wait. Leia!
487
00:58:39,308 to 00:58:40,809
Hey, wait!
488
00:58:47,066 to 00:58:49,609
Quick, jam their comlink. Center switch.
489
00:59:01,163 to 00:59:02,789
Move closer.
490
00:59:05,209 to 00:59:06,751
Get alongside that one.
491
00:59:48,085 to 00:59:50,253
Keep on that one. I'll take these two.
492
01:02:04,138 to 01:02:05,972
General Solo, somebody's coming.
493
01:02:19,278 to 01:02:20,445
Where's Leia?
494
01:02:21,155 to 01:02:23,698
She didn't come back?
I thought she was with you.
495
01:02:23,782 to 01:02:26,326
We got separated.
We better go look for her.
496
01:02:26,410 to 01:02:29,495
Take the squad ahead. We'll meet
at the shield generator at 0300.
497
01:02:29,580 to 01:02:31,664
Come on, R2. We'll need your scanners.
498
01:02:32,875 to 01:02:35,543
Don't worry, Master Luke.
We know what to do.
499
01:02:37,004 to 01:02:39,172
And you said it was pretty here.
500
01:03:01,904 to 01:03:03,863
Cut it out.
501
01:03:20,631 to 01:03:22,757
I'm not gonna hurt you.
502
01:03:30,766 to 01:03:33,476
Well, looks like I'm stuck here.
503
01:03:35,437 to 01:03:37,772
Trouble is, I don't know where here is.
504
01:03:38,774 to 01:03:40,775
Maybe you can help me.
505
01:03:41,985 to 01:03:43,736
Come on. Sit down.
506
01:03:45,739 to 01:03:47,865
I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.
507
01:03:49,535 to 01:03:52,078
All right. You want something to eat?
508
01:03:58,794 to 01:04:00,294
That's right.
509
01:04:05,175 to 01:04:06,926
Come on.
510
01:04:27,114 to 01:04:28,531
Look. It's a hat.
511
01:04:28,615 to 01:04:30,616
It's not gonna hurt you. Look.
512
01:04:37,458 to 01:04:39,709
You're a jittery little thing, aren't you?
513
01:04:44,965 to 01:04:46,466
What is it?
514
01:05:26,131 to 01:05:27,465
Freeze!
515
01:05:27,549 to 01:05:29,842
Come on. Get up.
516
01:05:34,181 to 01:05:37,016
Get your ride. Take her back to base.
Yes, sir.
517
01:05:41,772 to 01:05:43,022
What the...
518
01:05:59,998 to 01:06:02,625
Come on. Let's get out of here.
519
01:06:44,376 to 01:06:47,503
I told you to remain on the command ship.
520
01:06:49,047 to 01:06:53,968
A small rebel force has penetrated
the shield and landed on Endor.
521
01:06:55,512 to 01:06:57,263
Yes, I know.
522
01:06:58,765 to 01:07:01,017
My son is with them.
523
01:07:02,644 to 01:07:07,315
Are you sure?
I have felt him, my master.
524
01:07:08,734 to 01:07:11,277
Strange that I have not.
525
01:07:12,821 to 01:07:18,075
I wonder if your feelings
on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
526
01:07:18,160 to 01:07:20,953
They are clear, my master.
527
01:07:21,038 to 01:07:25,333
Then you must go to
the sanctuary moon and wait for him.
528
01:07:25,417 to 01:07:28,461
He will come to me?
529
01:07:30,672 to 01:07:33,049
I have foreseen it.
530
01:07:33,133 to 01:07:37,219
His compassion for you will be his undoing.
531
01:07:37,304 to 01:07:41,307
He will come to you,
and then you will bring him before me.
532
01:07:42,142 to 01:07:43,643
As you wish.
533
01:08:05,123 to 01:08:06,624
Master Luke.
534
01:08:10,253 to 01:08:13,047
There's two more wrecked speeders
back there.
535
01:08:13,131 to 01:08:15,132
And I found this.
536
01:08:16,551 to 01:08:20,972
I'm afraid that R2's sensors
can find no trace of Princess Leia.
537
01:08:23,350 to 01:08:25,017
I hope she's all right.
538
01:08:29,940 to 01:08:31,148
What, Chewie?
539
01:08:33,652 to 01:08:35,653
What, Chewie?
540
01:08:49,209 to 01:08:52,670
I don't get it. It's just a dead animal.
541
01:08:53,422 to 01:08:55,381
Chewie, wait! Don't!
542
01:08:59,845 to 01:09:01,345
Nice work.
543
01:09:03,098 to 01:09:04,974
Great, Chewie.
544
01:09:05,058 to 01:09:07,184
Great. Always thinking with your stomach.
545
01:09:07,269 to 01:09:10,479
Take it easy. Let's just figure
a way to get out of this thing.
546
01:09:10,564 to 01:09:12,314
Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
547
01:09:12,399 to 01:09:13,899
Yeah. Sure.
548
01:09:20,907 to 01:09:23,492
R2, I'm not sure that's such a good idea.
549
01:09:23,577 to 01:09:25,619
It's a very long drop!
550
01:10:08,497 to 01:10:11,457
Hey. Point that thing someplace else.
551
01:10:15,962 to 01:10:17,129
Hey!
552
01:10:17,214 to 01:10:19,757
Han, don't. It'll be all right.
553
01:10:25,931 to 01:10:28,432
Chewie, give them your crossbow.
554
01:10:30,477 to 01:10:32,144
Oh, my head.
555
01:10:36,358 to 01:10:38,192
Oh, my goodness.
556
01:11:09,975 to 01:11:11,934
Do you understand anything they're saying?
557
01:11:12,018 to 01:11:13,477
Oh, yes, Master Luke.
558
01:11:13,562 to 01:11:16,397
Remember that I am fluent
in over six million forms...
559
01:11:16,481 to 01:11:18,190
What are you telling them?
560
01:11:19,317 to 01:11:21,443
"Hello," I think.
561
01:11:21,528 to 01:11:24,613
I could be mistaken...
they're using a very primitive dialect...
562
01:11:24,698 to 01:11:28,325
but I do believe they think
I am some sort of god.
563
01:11:32,539 to 01:11:37,084
Why don't you use your divine
influence and get us out of this?
564
01:11:37,169 to 01:11:40,087
I beg your pardon, General Solo,
but that just wouldn't be proper.
565
01:11:41,047 to 01:11:42,464
Proper?
566
01:11:42,549 to 01:11:45,217
It's against my programming
to impersonate a deity.
567
01:11:45,302 to 01:11:46,594
Why, you...
568
01:11:54,769 to 01:11:56,353
My mistake.
569
01:11:57,981 to 01:11:59,982
He's an old friend of mine.
570
01:12:27,093 to 01:12:28,510
Hey.
571
01:12:45,654 to 01:12:48,155
I have a really bad feeling about this.
572
01:13:09,135 to 01:13:10,761
What did he say?
573
01:13:10,845 to 01:13:13,222
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo...
574
01:13:13,306 to 01:13:16,850
but it appears you are to be the main
course at a banquet in my honor.
575
01:13:34,327 to 01:13:36,745
Your Royal Highness.
576
01:13:36,830 to 01:13:38,664
These are my friends.
577
01:13:41,668 to 01:13:45,963
3PO, tell them they must be set free.
578
01:14:03,690 to 01:14:06,900
Somehow I got the feeling
that didn't help us very much.
579
01:14:06,985 to 01:14:10,946
3PO, tell them if they don't do
as you wish...
580
01:14:11,031 to 01:14:13,032
you'll become angry and use your magic.
581
01:14:13,116 to 01:14:15,534
But, Master Luke, what magic?
I couldn't possibly...
582
01:14:15,618 to 01:14:17,202
Tell them.
583
01:14:33,094 to 01:14:35,220
You see, Master Luke?
They didn't believe me...
584
01:14:35,305 to 01:14:36,930
just as I said they wouldn't.
585
01:14:37,015 to 01:14:38,349
Wait.
586
01:14:46,941 to 01:14:48,901
What's happening?
587
01:14:54,240 to 01:14:55,991
Put me down! Help!
588
01:14:56,076 to 01:14:57,701
Somebody!
589
01:14:57,786 to 01:14:59,119
Somebody help!
590
01:14:59,204 to 01:15:01,955
Master Luke! R2, quickly!
591
01:15:33,780 to 01:15:35,114
Thank goodness.
592
01:15:47,377 to 01:15:49,128
Thanks, 3PO.
593
01:15:50,296 to 01:15:52,297
I never knew I had it in me.
594
01:15:59,848 to 01:16:01,348
...Tatooine...
595
01:16:02,725 to 01:16:05,185
Princess Leia... R2.
596
01:16:07,313 to 01:16:08,814
...Darth Vader!
597
01:16:11,901 to 01:16:13,694
...Death Star.
598
01:16:16,656 to 01:16:18,949
...Jedi... ObiWan Kenobi.
599
01:16:24,497 to 01:16:26,457
Yes, R2, I was just coming to that.
600
01:16:29,836 to 01:16:30,878
Master Luke...
601
01:16:37,510 to 01:16:41,180
...Millennium Falcon ... Cloud City.
602
01:16:43,808 to 01:16:44,933
...Vader!
603
01:16:45,935 to 01:16:47,227
Han Solo...
604
01:16:49,355 to 01:16:50,856
...carbon.
605
01:16:52,400 to 01:16:53,692
...Sarlacc.
606
01:17:15,298 to 01:17:18,217
What's going on?
I don't know.
607
01:17:31,898 to 01:17:34,608
Wonderful. We are now a part of the tribe.
608
01:17:35,985 to 01:17:37,903
Just what I always wanted.
609
01:17:49,666 to 01:17:52,042
Short help's better than
no help at all, Chewie.
610
01:17:57,590 to 01:18:00,717
The scouts will show us the quickest
way to the shield generator.
611
01:18:00,802 to 01:18:02,928
Good. How far is it?
612
01:18:03,012 to 01:18:04,513
Ask him.
613
01:18:05,848 to 01:18:08,016
We need some fresh supplies too.
614
01:18:08,101 to 01:18:10,102
Try and get our weapons back.
615
01:18:11,521 to 01:18:13,772
Hurry up. I haven't got all day.
616
01:18:16,234 to 01:18:18,151
Luke, what's wrong?
617
01:18:20,029 to 01:18:23,532
Leia, do you remember your mother...
618
01:18:23,616 to 01:18:25,701
your real mother?
619
01:18:25,785 to 01:18:29,329
Just a little bit.
She died when I was very young.
620
01:18:29,414 to 01:18:31,373
What do you remember?
621
01:18:31,457 to 01:18:34,084
Just images really. Feelings.
622
01:18:34,168 to 01:18:35,669
Tell me.
623
01:18:37,463 to 01:18:40,549
She was... very beautiful.
624
01:18:40,633 to 01:18:43,302
Kind... but sad.
625
01:18:45,430 to 01:18:48,265
Why are you asking me this?
626
01:18:48,349 to 01:18:50,851
I have no memory of my mother.
627
01:18:51,853 to 01:18:53,937
I never knew her.
628
01:18:55,648 to 01:18:57,858
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
629
01:19:02,739 to 01:19:06,617
Vader is here. Now. On this moon.
630
01:19:08,161 to 01:19:09,911
How do you know?
631
01:19:09,996 to 01:19:11,955
I felt his presence.
632
01:19:12,832 to 01:19:16,209
He's come for me.
He can feel when I'm near.
633
01:19:16,294 to 01:19:18,253
That's why I have to go.
634
01:19:18,338 to 01:19:21,840
As long as I stay, I'm endangering
the group and our mission here.
635
01:19:22,842 to 01:19:25,844
I have to face him.
Why?
636
01:19:30,683 to 01:19:32,726
He's my father.
637
01:19:36,731 to 01:19:38,231
Your father?
638
01:19:39,567 to 01:19:43,612
There's more. It won't be easy
for you to hear it, but you must.
639
01:19:43,696 to 01:19:46,573
If I don't make it back,
you're the only hope for the Alliance.
640
01:19:46,658 to 01:19:48,200
Don't talk that way.
641
01:19:48,284 to 01:19:52,829
You have a power I don't understand
and could never have.
642
01:19:52,914 to 01:19:54,956
You're wrong, Leia.
643
01:19:55,041 to 01:19:56,917
You have that power too.
644
01:19:57,001 to 01:20:00,379
In time, you'll learn to use it as I have.
645
01:20:04,967 to 01:20:07,260
The Force is strong in my family.
646
01:20:08,680 to 01:20:10,722
My father has it.
647
01:20:12,058 to 01:20:14,017
I have it.
648
01:20:14,102 to 01:20:15,435
And...
649
01:20:16,729 to 01:20:19,147
my sister has it.
650
01:20:25,405 to 01:20:28,573
Yes. It's you, Leia.
651
01:20:33,788 to 01:20:35,288
I know.
652
01:20:38,251 to 01:20:39,751
Somehow...
653
01:20:41,587 to 01:20:43,213
I've always known.
654
01:20:43,297 to 01:20:45,298
Then you know why I have to face him.
655
01:20:47,218 to 01:20:49,845
Luke, run away. Far away.
656
01:20:49,929 to 01:20:53,306
If he can feel your presence,
then leave this place.
657
01:20:53,391 to 01:20:56,685
I wish I could go with you.
No, you don't.
658
01:20:56,769 to 01:20:58,770
You've always been strong.
659
01:21:00,022 to 01:21:02,357
But why must you confront him?
660
01:21:02,442 to 01:21:06,194
Because there is good in him. I've felt it.
661
01:21:06,279 to 01:21:08,321
He won't turn me over to the emperor.
662
01:21:08,406 to 01:21:11,575
I can save him. I can turn him
back to the good side.
663
01:21:12,952 to 01:21:14,786
I have to try.
664
01:21:33,264 to 01:21:35,265
Hey, what's going on?
665
01:21:36,809 to 01:21:40,312
Nothing. I just wanna
be alone for a little while.
666
01:21:41,647 to 01:21:43,148
Nothing?
667
01:21:45,067 to 01:21:47,027
Tell me. What's going on?
668
01:21:52,074 to 01:21:54,367
I can't tell you.
669
01:21:55,828 to 01:21:58,622
Could you tell Luke?
Is that who you could tell?
670
01:22:16,432 to 01:22:17,933
I'm sorry.
671
01:22:21,687 to 01:22:23,271
Hold me.
672
01:23:16,784 to 01:23:18,702
This is the rebel that surrendered.
673
01:23:18,786 to 01:23:21,746
Although he denies it,
I believe there may be more of them...
674
01:23:21,831 to 01:23:24,583
and I request permission
to conduct a further search of the area.
675
01:23:25,459 to 01:23:28,086
He was armed only with this.
676
01:23:30,172 to 01:23:32,090
Good work, Commander.
677
01:23:32,174 to 01:23:34,134
Leave us.
678
01:23:34,218 to 01:23:37,929
Conduct your search
and bring his companions to me.
679
01:23:39,348 to 01:23:41,016
Yes, my lord.
680
01:23:42,935 to 01:23:45,103
The emperor has been expecting you.
681
01:23:46,439 to 01:23:47,939
I know, Father.
682
01:23:49,358 to 01:23:51,776
So, you have accepted the truth.
683
01:23:52,862 to 01:23:56,406
I've accepted the truth that you were
once Anakin Skywalker, my father.
684
01:23:56,490 to 01:23:59,784
That name no longer has any meaning for me.
685
01:24:00,369 to 01:24:03,288
It is the name of your true self.
You've only forgotten.
686
01:24:03,915 to 01:24:05,707
I know there is good in you.
687
01:24:05,791 to 01:24:08,460
The emperor hasn't driven it
from you fully.
688
01:24:12,298 to 01:24:14,633
That was why you couldn't destroy me.
689
01:24:15,551 to 01:24:18,219
That's why you won't bring me
to your emperor now.
690
01:24:25,436 to 01:24:28,521
I see you have constructed
a new lightsaber.
691
01:24:32,109 to 01:24:35,111
Your skills are complete.
692
01:24:40,201 to 01:24:44,955
Indeed you are powerful,
as the emperor has foreseen.
693
01:24:49,835 to 01:24:51,670
Come with me.
694
01:24:53,547 to 01:24:56,591
ObiWan once thought as you do.
695
01:24:57,843 to 01:25:02,597
You don't know the power of the dark side.
696
01:25:02,682 to 01:25:05,517
I must obey my master.
697
01:25:06,519 to 01:25:10,063
I will not turn,
and you'll be forced to kill me.
698
01:25:11,232 to 01:25:14,025
If that is your destiny.
699
01:25:14,110 to 01:25:17,946
Search your feelings, Father.
You can't do this.
700
01:25:18,030 to 01:25:20,699
I feel the conflict within you.
Let go of your hate.
701
01:25:21,867 to 01:25:25,370
It is too late for me, son.
702
01:25:28,249 to 01:25:32,919
The emperor will show you
the true nature of the Force.
703
01:25:33,004 to 01:25:36,715
He is your master now.
704
01:25:40,511 to 01:25:43,138
Then my father is truly dead.
705
01:26:26,015 to 01:26:30,226
The main entrance to the control bunker is
on the far side of that landing platform.
706
01:26:31,020 to 01:26:34,689
This isn't gonna be easy.
Don't worry.
707
01:26:34,774 to 01:26:37,942
Chewie and me got into a lot of places
more heavily guarded than this.
708
01:26:46,410 to 01:26:47,911
What's he saying?
709
01:26:47,995 to 01:26:51,372
He says there's a secret entrance
on the other side of the ridge.
710
01:27:10,559 to 01:27:13,978
Admiral, we're in position.
All fighters accounted for.
711
01:27:14,688 to 01:27:16,815
Proceed with the countdown.
712
01:27:17,983 to 01:27:20,485
All groups assume attack coordinates.
713
01:27:23,823 to 01:27:25,824
Don't worry. My friend's down there.
714
01:27:25,908 to 01:27:28,493
He'll have that shield down on time.
715
01:27:31,288 to 01:27:33,957
Or this'll be
the shortest offensive of all time.
716
01:27:35,751 to 01:27:39,629
All craft, prepare to jump
into hyperspace on my mark.
717
01:27:39,713 to 01:27:41,714
All right. Stand by.
718
01:28:01,193 to 01:28:03,444
Back door, huh? Good idea.
719
01:28:11,620 to 01:28:14,831
It's only a few guards.
This shouldn't be too much trouble.
720
01:28:19,920 to 01:28:22,797
It only takes one to sound the alarm.
721
01:28:22,882 to 01:28:25,425
Then we'll do it real quietlike.
722
01:28:25,509 to 01:28:28,052
Oh, my. Princess Leia.
Quiet.
723
01:28:29,346 to 01:28:31,181
I'm afraid our furry companion...
724
01:28:31,265 to 01:28:33,433
has gone and done something rather rash.
725
01:28:38,772 to 01:28:40,899
There goes our surprise attack.
726
01:28:48,157 to 01:28:50,450
Look, over there! Stop him!
727
01:29:02,213 to 01:29:05,298
Not bad for a little furball.
There's only one left.
728
01:29:05,382 to 01:29:07,967
You stay here. We'll take care of this.
729
01:29:09,929 to 01:29:12,305
I have decided that we shall stay here.
730
01:29:42,169 to 01:29:43,169
Hey!
731
01:30:47,276 to 01:30:50,111
Welcome, young Skywalker.
732
01:30:50,195 to 01:30:52,572
I have been expecting you.
733
01:30:53,574 to 01:30:55,575
You'll no longer need those.
734
01:31:00,998 to 01:31:02,915
Guards, leave us.
735
01:31:10,299 to 01:31:13,801
I'm looking forward
to completing your training.
736
01:31:13,886 to 01:31:19,015
In time, you will call me master.
737
01:31:19,099 to 01:31:21,684
You're gravely mistaken.
738
01:31:21,769 to 01:31:23,895
You won't convert me as you did my father.
739
01:31:24,438 to 01:31:28,483
Oh, no, my young Jedi.
740
01:31:30,569 to 01:31:34,697
You will find that
it is you who are mistaken...
741
01:31:36,075 to 01:31:40,244
about a great many things.
742
01:31:41,914 to 01:31:43,414
His lightsaber.
743
01:31:43,499 to 01:31:47,418
Ah, yes. A Jedi's weapon.
744
01:31:48,128 to 01:31:50,588
Much like your father's.
745
01:31:50,672 to 01:31:55,510
By now you must know your father
can never be turned from the dark side.
746
01:31:55,594 to 01:31:58,471
So will it be with you.
747
01:31:58,555 to 01:32:00,515
You're wrong.
748
01:32:00,599 to 01:32:03,893
Soon I'll be dead... and you with me.
749
01:32:07,272 to 01:32:11,609
Perhaps you refer to
the imminent attack of your rebel fleet.
750
01:32:12,403 to 01:32:13,861
Yes.
751
01:32:13,946 to 01:32:19,117
I assure you we are quite safe
from your friends here.
752
01:32:20,244 to 01:32:23,162
Your overconfidence is your weakness.
753
01:32:23,247 to 01:32:26,416
Your faith in your friends is yours.
754
01:32:28,919 to 01:32:32,588
It is pointless to resist, my son.
755
01:32:36,552 to 01:32:42,056
Everything that has transpired
has done so according to my design.
756
01:32:42,141 to 01:32:45,393
Your friends up there
on the sanctuary moon...
757
01:32:45,477 to 01:32:49,856
are walking into a trap,
as is your rebel fleet.
758
01:32:51,733 to 01:32:54,277
It was I who allowed the Alliance...
759
01:32:54,361 to 01:32:57,822
to know the location
of the shield generator.
760
01:32:57,906 to 01:33:01,993
It is quite safe
from your pitiful little band.
761
01:33:02,077 to 01:33:06,372
An entire legion
of my best troops awaits them.
762
01:33:08,834 to 01:33:12,628
I'm afraid the deflector shield...
763
01:33:12,713 to 01:33:17,967
will be quite operational
when your friends arrive.
764
01:33:21,472 to 01:33:22,847
All right!
765
01:33:22,931 to 01:33:24,474
Up! Move!
766
01:33:24,558 to 01:33:26,058
Quickly. Quickly.
767
01:33:30,522 to 01:33:32,190
Han, hurry.
768
01:33:32,274 to 01:33:34,192
The fleet will be here any moment.
769
01:33:35,861 to 01:33:38,196
Charges. Come on. Come on!
770
01:33:40,240 to 01:33:42,158
Oh, my. They'll be captured.
771
01:33:44,953 to 01:33:46,704
Wait! Come back!
772
01:33:49,166 to 01:33:51,042
R2, stay with me.
773
01:33:52,044 to 01:33:53,711
Freeze!
774
01:33:57,007 to 01:33:59,008
You rebel scum.
775
01:34:18,654 to 01:34:22,073
All wings report in.
Red Leader standing by.
776
01:34:22,157 to 01:34:25,409
Gray Leader standing by.
Green Leader standing by.
777
01:34:26,203 to 01:34:28,371
Lock Sfoils in attack positions.
778
01:34:32,000 to 01:34:34,168
May the Force be with us.
779
01:34:37,714 to 01:34:40,758
We've gotta be able to get
a reading on that shield... up or down.
780
01:34:42,386 to 01:34:45,096
How could they be jamming us
if they don't know...
781
01:34:46,098 to 01:34:47,723
if we're coming.
782
01:34:47,808 to 01:34:51,352
Break off the attack.
The shield is still up.
783
01:34:51,436 to 01:34:53,563
I get no reading. You sure?
784
01:34:53,647 to 01:34:55,898
Pull up! All craft pull up!
785
01:35:00,320 to 01:35:04,323
Take evasive action. Green Group,
stick close to Holding Sector MV7.
786
01:35:06,118 to 01:35:08,911
Admiral, we have enemy ships in Sector 47.
787
01:35:08,996 to 01:35:10,580
It's a trap.
788
01:35:14,084 to 01:35:16,085
Fighters coming in.
789
01:35:19,506 to 01:35:20,923
There's too many.
790
01:35:24,177 to 01:35:27,597
Accelerate to attack speed.
Draw their fire away from the cruisers.
791
01:35:27,681 to 01:35:28,806
Copy, Gold Leader.
792
01:35:32,144 to 01:35:33,686
Come, boy.
793
01:35:34,521 to 01:35:36,522
See for yourself.
794
01:35:39,151 to 01:35:44,405
From here, you will witness
the final destruction of the Alliance...
795
01:35:44,489 to 01:35:48,367
and the end
of your insignificant rebellion.
796
01:35:53,582 to 01:35:56,000
You want this...
797
01:35:56,710 to 01:35:58,628
don't you?
798
01:35:58,712 to 01:36:03,299
The hate is swelling in you now.
799
01:36:04,009 to 01:36:06,218
Take your Jedi weapon.
800
01:36:06,303 to 01:36:08,095
Use it.
801
01:36:08,180 to 01:36:10,181
I am unarmed.
802
01:36:10,265 to 01:36:12,183
Strike me down with it.
803
01:36:12,267 to 01:36:14,852
Give in to your anger.
804
01:36:15,854 to 01:36:21,025
With each passing moment
you make yourself more my servant.
805
01:36:27,574 to 01:36:29,617
It is unavoidable.
806
01:36:30,619 to 01:36:32,870
It is your destiny.
807
01:36:33,872 to 01:36:37,083
You, like your father...
808
01:36:37,167 to 01:36:38,793
are now...
809
01:36:39,670 to 01:36:41,337
mine.
810
01:36:59,439 to 01:37:01,857
All right, move it.
811
01:37:09,783 to 01:37:11,450
Hello. I say, over there.
812
01:37:12,202 to 01:37:14,578
Were you looking for me?
813
01:37:15,872 to 01:37:17,957
Bring those two down here.
814
01:37:25,549 to 01:37:29,885
They're on their way.
R2, are you sure this was a good idea?
815
01:37:29,970 to 01:37:31,345
Freeze.
816
01:37:31,430 to 01:37:32,596
Don't move.
817
01:37:32,681 to 01:37:34,640
We surrender.
818
01:39:40,267 to 01:39:42,184
The code's changed.
819
01:39:42,269 to 01:39:44,687
We need R2.
Here's the terminal.
820
01:39:44,771 to 01:39:46,814
R2, where are you?
821
01:39:46,898 to 01:39:48,899
We need you at the bunker right away.
822
01:39:50,944 to 01:39:52,528
Going? What do you mean?
823
01:39:54,155 to 01:39:55,823
Going where, R2?
824
01:39:55,907 to 01:40:00,160
Wait. R2, this is no time for heroics.
825
01:40:00,245 to 01:40:01,954
Come back!
826
01:40:28,148 to 01:40:29,982
Watch yourself, Wedge. Three from above.
827
01:40:30,066 to 01:40:33,068
Red Three, Red Two, pull in.
Got it.
828
01:40:36,239 to 01:40:38,032
Three of them coming in, 20 degrees.
829
01:40:38,116 to 01:40:39,909
Cut left. I'll take the leader.
830
01:40:48,168 to 01:40:49,960
They're heading for the medical frigate.
831
01:40:54,925 to 01:40:56,175
Pressure's steady.
832
01:41:05,310 to 01:41:08,646
Only the fighters are attacking.
What are the Stardestroyers waiting for?
833
01:41:13,234 to 01:41:14,985
We're in attack position, sir.
834
01:41:15,070 to 01:41:18,280
Hold here.
We're not going to attack?
835
01:41:18,365 to 01:41:21,700
My orders are from the emperor himself.
He has something special planned.
836
01:41:21,785 to 01:41:23,786
We only need to keep them from escaping.
837
01:41:25,413 to 01:41:29,541
As you can see, my young apprentice...
838
01:41:29,626 to 01:41:32,878
your friends have failed.
839
01:41:33,672 to 01:41:36,090
Now witness the firepower...
840
01:41:36,174 to 01:41:41,553
of this fully armed
and operational battle station.
841
01:41:42,681 to 01:41:45,265
Fire at will, Commander.
842
01:41:52,232 to 01:41:54,024
Fire.
843
01:42:00,573 to 01:42:03,200
That blast came from the Death Star.
844
01:42:04,077 to 01:42:06,453
That thing's operational.
845
01:42:06,538 to 01:42:08,414
Home 1, this is Gold Leader.
846
01:42:08,498 to 01:42:10,624
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
847
01:42:10,709 to 01:42:12,960
You won't get another chance at this,
Admiral.
848
01:42:13,044 to 01:42:15,838
We have no choice, General Calrissian.
849
01:42:15,922 to 01:42:19,258
Our cruisers can't repel
firepower of that magnitude.
850
01:42:19,342 to 01:42:23,053
Han will have that shield down.
We've gotta give him more time.
851
01:42:41,865 to 01:42:43,365
We're coming.
852
01:42:49,164 to 01:42:50,497
Come on.
853
01:42:54,294 to 01:42:55,753
R2, hurry!
854
01:43:01,718 to 01:43:02,760
My goodness!
855
01:43:08,767 to 01:43:10,726
Why did you have to be so brave?
856
01:43:13,938 to 01:43:16,523
Well, I suppose
I could hotwire this thing.
857
01:43:16,608 to 01:43:18,108
I'll cover you.
858
01:43:59,651 to 01:44:02,152
Yes, I said closer.
Move as close as you can...
859
01:44:02,237 to 01:44:04,988
and engage those Stardestroyers
at pointblank range.
860
01:44:05,073 to 01:44:08,534
At that close range, we won't last long
against those Stardestroyers.
861
01:44:08,618 to 01:44:11,286
We'll last longer than we will
against that Death Star...
862
01:44:11,371 to 01:44:13,664
and we might take a few of them with us.
863
01:44:16,543 to 01:44:17,960
She's gonna blow!
864
01:44:21,965 to 01:44:23,632
I'm hit!
865
01:44:28,721 to 01:44:30,931
Your fleet is lost...
866
01:44:31,015 to 01:44:35,102
and your friends on the Endor moon
will not survive.
867
01:44:37,355 to 01:44:39,815
There is no escape...
868
01:44:39,899 to 01:44:42,568
my young apprentice.
869
01:44:44,737 to 01:44:47,239
The Alliance will die...
870
01:44:49,075 to 01:44:51,994
as will your friends.
871
01:44:55,540 to 01:44:56,874
Good.
872
01:44:57,876 to 01:45:01,170
I can feel your anger.
873
01:45:02,839 to 01:45:06,383
I am defenseless. Take your weapon.
874
01:45:06,467 to 01:45:09,636
Strike me down with all of your hatred...
875
01:45:09,721 to 01:45:14,266
and your journey towards
the dark side will be complete.
876
01:45:53,514 to 01:45:55,599
Look!
Get him off of there.
877
01:47:48,713 to 01:47:50,756
I think I got it.
878
01:47:50,840 to 01:47:52,174
I got it!
879
01:47:59,390 to 01:48:00,724
Are you all right?
880
01:48:00,808 to 01:48:02,726
Let's see.
It's not bad.
881
01:48:02,810 to 01:48:04,144
Freeze!
Oh, dear.
882
01:48:04,228 to 01:48:05,771
Don't move.
883
01:48:10,193 to 01:48:12,986
I love you.
I know.
884
01:48:13,071 to 01:48:14,404
Hands up.
885
01:48:15,531 to 01:48:16,740
Stand up.
886
01:48:26,542 to 01:48:28,043
Stay back.
887
01:48:35,927 to 01:48:38,678
Get down here. She's wounded.
888
01:48:38,763 to 01:48:40,639
No, wait.
889
01:48:40,723 to 01:48:42,349
I got an idea.
890
01:48:53,611 to 01:48:55,153
Good.
891
01:48:55,238 to 01:48:59,074
Use your aggressive feelings, boy.
892
01:48:59,158 to 01:49:01,952
Let the hate flow through you.
893
01:49:07,542 to 01:49:11,169
ObiWan has taught you well.
894
01:49:14,590 to 01:49:17,008
I will not fight you, Father.
895
01:49:31,065 to 01:49:33,942
You are unwise to lower your defenses.
896
01:49:58,801 to 01:50:01,261
Your thoughts betray you, Father.
897
01:50:01,345 to 01:50:04,514
I feel the good in you, the conflict.
898
01:50:04,599 to 01:50:07,142
There is no conflict.
899
01:50:09,437 to 01:50:11,438
You couldn't bring yourself
to kill me before...
900
01:50:11,522 to 01:50:13,523
and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
901
01:50:13,608 to 01:50:18,195
You underestimate
the power of the dark side.
902
01:50:18,279 to 01:50:19,946
If you will not fight...
903
01:50:20,031 to 01:50:22,866
then you will meet your destiny.
904
01:50:34,295 to 01:50:35,629
Good.
905
01:50:35,713 to 01:50:37,088
Good.
906
01:50:45,723 to 01:50:49,392
Watch out. Squad at .06.
I'm on it, Gold Leader.
907
01:50:51,270 to 01:50:52,729
Good shot, Red Two.
908
01:50:56,317 to 01:50:59,444
We're sure in the middle of it now.
Come on, Han, old buddy.
909
01:50:59,529 to 01:51:01,238
Don't let me down.
910
01:51:05,743 to 01:51:07,244
It's over, Commander.
911
01:51:07,328 to 01:51:09,704
The rebels have been routed.
They're fleeing.
912
01:51:09,789 to 01:51:12,415
We need reinforcements
to continue the pursuit.
913
01:51:13,417 to 01:51:15,418
Send three squads to help.
914
01:51:15,503 to 01:51:17,504
Open the back door.
Sir.
915
01:51:31,644 to 01:51:33,103
Throw me another charge.
916
01:51:50,621 to 01:51:53,456
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
917
01:51:54,667 to 01:51:56,626
I will not fight you.
918
01:52:00,089 to 01:52:03,174
Give yourself to the dark side.
919
01:52:04,719 to 01:52:08,805
It is the only way
you can save your friends.
920
01:52:09,807 to 01:52:11,558
Yes.
921
01:52:11,642 to 01:52:13,643
Your thoughts betray you.
922
01:52:13,728 to 01:52:16,313
Your feelings for them are strong...
923
01:52:16,397 to 01:52:18,315
especially for...
924
01:52:20,443 to 01:52:21,943
sister.
925
01:52:23,362 to 01:52:27,741
So you have a twin sister.
926
01:52:27,825 to 01:52:31,578
Your feelings have now betrayed her too.
927
01:52:31,662 to 01:52:35,790
ObiWan was wise to hide her from me.
928
01:52:35,875 to 01:52:40,337
Now his failure is complete.
929
01:52:41,756 to 01:52:45,592
If you will not turn to the dark side...
930
01:52:45,676 to 01:52:48,511
then perhaps she will.
931
01:52:48,596 to 01:52:49,554
Never!
932
01:53:35,142 to 01:53:36,893
Good!
933
01:53:41,190 to 01:53:43,942
Your hate has made you powerful.
934
01:53:45,194 to 01:53:50,115
Now, fulfill your destiny...
935
01:53:50,199 to 01:53:54,369
and take your father's place at my side.
936
01:54:09,343 to 01:54:10,677
Never.
937
01:54:13,723 to 01:54:15,932
I'll never turn to the dark side.
938
01:54:18,853 to 01:54:21,730
You've failed, Your Highness.
939
01:54:21,814 to 01:54:23,815
I am a Jedi...
940
01:54:23,899 to 01:54:25,984
like my father before me.
941
01:54:33,534 to 01:54:37,036
So be it, Jedi.
942
01:54:37,246 to 01:54:39,205
Move! Move!
943
01:54:51,719 to 01:54:55,638
The shield is down. Commence attack
on the Death Star's main reactor.
944
01:54:55,723 to 01:54:59,517
We're on our way. Red Group,
Gold Group, all fighters follow me.
945
01:54:59,602 to 01:55:01,603
I told you they'd do it.
946
01:55:08,652 to 01:55:11,321
If you will not be turned...
947
01:55:11,405 to 01:55:14,824
you will be destroyed.
948
01:55:21,791 to 01:55:23,374
Young fool.
949
01:55:24,376 to 01:55:27,378
Only now, at the end...
950
01:55:27,463 to 01:55:29,380
do you understand.
951
01:55:42,520 to 01:55:48,358
Your feeble skills are no match
for the power of the dark side.
952
01:55:52,112 to 01:55:56,032
You have paid the price
for your lack of vision.
953
01:56:01,539 to 01:56:03,289
Father, please!
954
01:56:18,681 to 01:56:20,890
Now, young Skywalker...
955
01:56:22,977 to 01:56:24,811
you will die.
956
01:56:50,337 to 01:56:52,380
No.
957
01:56:54,508 to 01:56:56,759
No!
958
01:57:47,561 to 01:57:49,103
I'm going in.
959
01:57:52,191 to 01:57:53,483
Here goes nothing.
960
01:58:00,491 to 01:58:04,452
Lock onto the strongest power source.
It should be the power generator.
961
01:58:06,622 to 01:58:10,124
Form up. Stay alert.
We could run out of space real fast.
962
01:58:25,724 to 01:58:27,767
Split up and head back to the surface.
963
01:58:27,851 to 01:58:31,062
See if you can get a few
of those TIE fighters to follow you.
964
01:58:31,146 to 01:58:32,188
Copy, Gold Leader.
965
01:58:42,408 to 01:58:44,033
That was too close.
966
01:58:47,997 to 01:58:50,206
We've got to give those fighters more time.
967
01:58:50,290 to 01:58:53,376
Concentrate all fire
on that Super Stardestroyer.
968
01:58:59,466 to 01:59:01,634
Sir, we've lost
our bridge deflector shields.
969
01:59:01,719 to 01:59:04,762
Intensify the forward batteries.
I don't want anything to get through.
970
01:59:07,224 to 01:59:09,058
Intensify forward firepower!
971
01:59:10,811 to 01:59:12,061
Too late!
972
01:59:57,107 to 02:00:01,027
Help me take this mask off.
973
02:00:01,111 to 02:00:02,862
But you'll die.
974
02:00:03,864 to 02:00:07,450
Nothing can stop that now.
975
02:00:08,452 to 02:00:10,119
Just for once...
976
02:00:10,871 to 02:00:12,705
let me...
977
02:00:12,790 to 02:00:16,292
look on you with my own eyes.
978
02:00:52,496 to 02:00:56,958
Now go, my son.
979
02:00:58,585 to 02:00:59,961
Leave me.
980
02:01:00,963 to 02:01:03,589
No. You're coming with me.
981
02:01:03,674 to 02:01:06,050
I'll not leave you here.
I've got to save you.
982
02:01:06,885 to 02:01:10,680
You already have, Luke.
983
02:01:11,765 to 02:01:13,683
You were right.
984
02:01:14,434 to 02:01:16,811
You were right about me.
985
02:01:18,689 to 02:01:20,523
Tell your sister...
986
02:01:21,525 to 02:01:23,860
you were right.
987
02:01:30,826 to 02:01:31,993
Father.
988
02:01:36,248 to 02:01:37,665
I won't leave you.
989
02:02:03,025 to 02:02:04,066
There it is.
990
02:02:06,987 to 02:02:09,405
Wedge, go for the power regulator
on the north tower.
991
02:02:09,489 to 02:02:12,867
Copy, Gold Leader.
I'm already on my way out.
992
02:02:32,012 to 02:02:35,223
Move the fleet away from the Death Star.
993
02:03:22,354 to 02:03:24,105
They did it!
994
02:03:32,489 to 02:03:34,991
I'm sure Luke wasn't
on that thing when it blew.
995
02:03:36,660 to 02:03:38,577
He wasn't.
996
02:03:38,662 to 02:03:40,371
I can feel it.
997
02:03:45,002 to 02:03:46,627
You love him.
998
02:03:49,965 to 02:03:51,424
Don't you?
999
02:03:51,508 to 02:03:53,009
Yes.
1000
02:03:53,093 to 02:03:55,845
All right. I understand.
1001
02:03:55,929 to 02:03:57,346
Fine.
1002
02:03:58,348 to 02:04:00,182
When he comes back...
1003
02:04:01,184 to 02:04:03,019
I won't get in the way.
1004
02:04:05,689 to 02:04:07,690
It's not like that at all.
1005
02:04:11,361 to 02:04:13,738
He's my brother.
1006
02:05:55,090 to 02:05:56,757
Wesa free!
1007
02:14:43,952 to 02:14:44,952
English US
